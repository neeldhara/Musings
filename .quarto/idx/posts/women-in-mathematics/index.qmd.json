The links are mostly to versions of the books on Amazon India. Unfortunately many of them are rather expensive, but hopefully it’s a handy list to share with a librarian you know! Do leave a comment below if you have any additions.\n\nI’ll also leave this [relatively sobering thought](https://twitter.com/virtualcourtney/status/1495076053257175040) (or [this one](https://twitter.com/MarissaKawehi/status/1495083281766879243?s=20&t=9CWcnFgcqBQZD4p01UFXsg)) here with no further comment.\n\n---\n\nBooks:\n\n1.
