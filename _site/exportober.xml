<p>You can find the original announcement <a href="../2021/">here</a> and more specifics clarifying the format (or the lack of it) <a href="../about/">here</a>. Here’s the short version:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put up a piece of content everyday between 27th September and 30th October, with the possibility of skipping one day per week;</li>
<li>Post a link to your content on Twitter with #exportober</li>
<li>That’s it, actually. 🤷‍♀️</li>
</ul>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="aside">📝 If you’d like to participate <del>you can sign up below</del>; and if you’d like to help, please encourage everyone participating by checking out the tweets coming in above!</span></div></div>
<p>Psst. It’s quite fine to sign up even if you’re reading this after the 27th of September. The automated tracking exercise here will stop after the 30th of October, so you can be a part of this by just contributing in this window. It certainly does’t <em>have</em> to be daily and it doesn’t <em>have</em> to be 30 things, although I found those to be useful default targets to work with for myself.</p>
</section>
<section id="sign-up" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sign-up">Sign up!</h2>
<p><del>While you can participate simply by using #exportober in your tweets, it’ll be great if you could explicitly enter your Twitter username in the form below, so we can check in on each other!</del> 🤝</p>
<p>While I’m not going to write a Twitter bot that will send you daily reminders over DM, I do hope to create a separate page for each registered participant at the end of the challenge that shows off just their entries in one place, so it’s helpful to know who you are 😀</p>

<p>In a massively impulsive move nudged by some Twitter feedback, I recently launched <a href="../2021/">the Exportober challenge</a>.</p>
<p>The TL;DR version:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put up a <strong>piece of content</strong>* everyday between 27th September and 30th October, with the possibility of skipping one day per week;</li>
<li>Post a link to your content on Twitter with #exportober</li>
<li>That’s it, actually. 🤷‍♀️</li>

<p>I was deliberately vague about the terms-and-conditions that goes with the piece of content piece above. The rules I mentioned were minimal: since there are no restrictions of age, keep the content SFW and generally legal. Other than that, anything goes, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can I doodle? Yes.</li>
<li>Can I meme? Yes.</li>
<li>Can I make a comic? Yes.</li>
<li>Can I quip? Yes.</li>
<li>Can I tweet a thread? Yes.</li>
<li>Can I tweet a single tweet? Yes.</li>
<li>Can I song and/or hum and/or dance? Yes.</li>
<li>Can I react? I am unfamiliar with this genre, but yeah, why not?</li>
<li>Can I just quote? Uhh, ok-fine, sure — maybe be sure to include a reaction?</li>
<li>Can I commit? Yes, please! Oh, you mean — can it be a GitHub commit? Right, yeah, sure.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, there are no restrictions on format or length or quality. It can be whatever you want, and however long or short you want it to be. The point is to <em>get into the habit</em> of putting a bit of yourself into something tangible that you’d want to share.</p>
<p>So while you could technically schedule thirty pieces of Harry Potter trivia in advance — <em>that</em> would kind of defeat the purpose.</p>

<p>In general, I imagine only you would know if this is for you — this may not be a priority or a point of interest for you right now, but if you’re reading this, possibly your interest is at least mildly piqued?</p>
<p>What this is about is setting aside some time for yourself and to participate alongside friends who’re in it for fun and profit:</p>

We often avoid taking action because we think "I need to learn more," but the best way to learn is often by taking action.

<ul>
<li>The fun bit is in the making and sharing.</li>
<li>The profit bit is the hope that we trick ourselves into making this a bit of a regular habit for life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Longer term, you may or may not want to be sharing or publishing on a daily basis. But hopefully, longer term, <strong>you are engaged with the process on a regular basis</strong>.</p>
<p>Personally, there’s almost nothing that I do consistently on a daily basis, not counting the things one needs to do continue being alive. I’d like to see if I can change that a bit<sup>1</sup>, and apparently doing such things bit by bit — and with some public commitment — <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">is a good idea</a>, hence the micro-nature of the challenge.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet blockquote" data-conversation="none">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">
So overall I’ve gotten to a point where I’m just afraid to even think about putting something together because I think it’s an unrealistic commitment of time. <br><br>I’m also really bad at chunking - everything I do of this sort manifests at the wrong end of an all-nighter 🙈

<p>Hmm. One way that you could still make this work for you is to build out your masterpiece bit by bit. If it’s a tutorial, you could plan it out in advance and work through one coherent section a day. If it’s a sketch, you could share your partial progress as you go along, and even put it together in a timelapse at the end? That would be great to see!</p>
<p>There are some types of long-form content that aren’t naturally amenable to this type of chunking; say you want to put together a video exposition, make an origami sculpture, or crochet a Klein bottle. In this situation, you could either use the challenge to document your process and progress; or you could just claim to engage in #exportoberlite with a reduced frequency of production — say once a week, or one masterpiece at the end — you’ll just have to still tweet it out so I can catalog it ❤️</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet blockquote">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">
I really don’t like the illusion that there is one process for making and that it involves writing every day. Thinking is work to. So is reading. So is doing things that seem unrelated to writing. Our brains are always thinking about what we’re making, whether we’re typing or not

<p>Also, while on the subject of masterpieces, there’s the <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2020/12/10/quantity-leads-to-quality-the-origin-of-a-parable/">parable of the pots</a>. On the other hand, everyone does have their own process, and the idea isn’t to force a format: this process is temporary, flexible, and optional 🙌</p>

<p>Oooh. Maybe just ping on Twitter if you are in this situation. I do imagine that there are folks who have more ideas than they can handle, so if you have the bandwidth, it’ll even out nicely! For some starter inspiration, just in case it is useful, here are some of the post types that I’m planning for the duration of this challenge, in roughly increasing order of desperation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Trying some of the <a href="https://www.tifr.res.in/~outreach/chai_and_why.html">Chai and Why? experiments</a> and documenting <del>any accidents</del> learnings.</li>
<li>Puzzles and programming contest roundups.</li>
<li>Lecture notes for classes/talks I’m teaching and/or attending.</li>
<li>Highlights from whatever podcasts I’m tuned into.</li>
<li>Clean up draft essays from previous lives.</li>
<li>Random doodles. And VSCode keyboard shortcuts.</li>
<li>Hot takes on inconsequential debates.<sup>2</sup></li>
</ol>
<p>I also have a few black holes nurtured over time — I’m looking at you, all my Read-It-<del>Never</del>Later apps, the starred section in my RSS app, my YouTube watchlist, and relatives. Maybe about time to go down some of these rabbit holes with the excuse of commentary to follow.</p>
<p>So yes, that’ll be all for now! Let’s see how this goes 🤞 Meanwhile, <a href="../2021/">please hop on</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/neeldhara/status/1439668714178105347">spread the word</a> for all of us? Thank you! 🎉</p>
<hr>
<p>PS. You might be curious about what participating will <em>look like</em>. I’m trying to setup a separate page for each participant in the challenge that will pull in all your tagged tweets. I’ll share a preview soon!</p>

  <title>An Invitation to Exportober 2021</title>

<p>You can also check out a little more about the format, intent and background <a href="../about/">here</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><p>As you can see — at least at the time of this writing — this is a blog under construction with some mild ambition, going by the long list of empty categories on the homepage.</p>
<p>I’ve heard a lot about the effectiveness of something something <em>public</em> something something <em>accountability</em>, so I’m going to give this a shot: if there’s anyone else who wants a bit of a jumpstart and encouragement for getting into the habit of putting stuff out there, this is for you!</p>
<p>Presenting the EXPress yOuR Thoughts, i.e, export, challenge.</p>
<p>Here be some rules, or not, make this your own!</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Put something out there — could be an essay, a video, a sketchnote, some code, a piece of music, a photograph — I think the only criteria is that this should be something you put together that you feel compelled to share, and something that can be accessed via a public URL. I suppose quotes and curated round-ups are good too, but ideally you want this to be something that has a bit of you in it.</li>
<li>Share it on Twitter with #exportober (umm, the export challenge in October 😬 … it had to be something that wasn’t already taken so I can scrape it off and put it up in one place, and everyone participating can keep an eye out on others participating — the general hope is that everyone finds themselves encouraged by everyone else 🎉).</li>
<li>I’m going to find a way of listing everything that comes up starting <strong>27th September</strong>. This gives you five weeks until the end of October. Try and get something up everyday - this puts the challenge in the Export Challenge 😀 That said, allowing ourselves one cheat day per week means that we all hopefully end up with 30 things by the 30th of October. Yays 🤞</li>
<li>Since I’ll hopefully find a way of tracking all the content tagged this way and automatically pushing it to a page where we can find it all in one place, please don’t put up anything illegal or damaging. Other than this, practically anything goes, but please do respect the basic idea, which is is to build up some positive vibes and keep this a fun exercise!</li>
</ol>
<p>So I hope you spend the coming week getting setup — figure out what you want to do and how you’ll do it, and maybe even cheating a little and preparing some buffer content for the rainy days? We’ve already had some great suggestions for tools you can use to get started:</p>
<div class="grid">
<div class="g-col-6">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet blockquote" data-conversation="none">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">
GitHub pages is great for this. I don't use Markdown, but it still works as a quick, lightweight publishing system, automatic ssh setup, etc. Since I store the content on GitHub anyway, everything is nicely unified.

May not commit for mutual accountability :) But a suggestion.<br><br>Instead of blogging platforms, how about markdown/Jupyter notebooks in a github repo and/or short code/docs as github gists?<br><br>Can use versioning to improve - no need to get the content "right" at the first "publish".
