These are some parts of the teaching statment that I wrote roughly seven years ago, updated slightly in the interest of clarity and additional context.

<p><em>A teacher does not teach, a student learns.</em></p>
<p>— snippet from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/425094961174523/videos/5530977776968824/">this interview</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakir_Hussain_(musician)">Ustad Zakir Hussain</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ll pose some how/what/why questions in the context of teaching.</p>
<section id="how" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how">How</h2>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>The last couple of decades, especially the last few years, have seen dramatic changes in how information is communicated. A lot of learning happens in online communities, for instance, question-and-answer websites like Quora and StackExchange. Thanks to folks who invest time on these platforms, expert help seems to be nearer than ever before. Specialized and snark-free communities on Discord/Slack/Telegram are enabling peer-to-peer learning at global scale. </p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="aside">I keep hearing that Quora is not what it used to be, but as long as <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Thomas-Cormen-1/">Thomas Cormen</a> is an active user, I am positive it remains a valuable resource.</span></div></div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Books are beginning to be injected with exciting new technology: <a href="https://codemirror.net/index.html">CodeMirror</a> makes code interactive and runnable, while tools like <a href="https://pythontutor.com/">PythonTutor</a> can help with visualizing what happens behind-the-scenes when code is executed. <a href="https://github.com/denysdovhan/wtfjs">Say</a> <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">what</a> <a href="https://wtfjs.com/">you</a> <a href="https://martin-thoma.com/javascript-wtf/">want</a> about JavaScript, but the interactivity that it brings to the written medium has helped make reading less passive. Some of my favorite interactive texts include <a href="https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/">Seeing Theory</a>, <a href="http://probmods.org/">Probabilistic Models of Cognition</a>, courses on <a href="https://brilliant.org/">Brilliant</a>, <a href="https://mathigon.org/">Mathigon</a>, and essays from <a href="https://ncase.me/">Nicky Case</a>, <a href="https://minutelabs.io/">Minute Labs</a>, and others on <a href="https://explorabl.es/">Explorables</a>.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="aside">The name “PythonTutor” is slightly misleading, since the website also lets you visualize code snippets written in C, C++, Java, and JavaScript.</span></div></div>
<div class="columns">
<div class="column" style="width:45%;">
<p>And finally there are the online courses. At the time of this writing, it has been just a little over two decades since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_OpenCourseWare">MIT’s Open Course Ware</a> opened to the public. The early hype around MOOCs roughly coincided with my years in college and graduate school. As far as I remember, it was quite the thrill to have free-flowing access to online lectures — “taught by the best” — for several of the courses I was supposed to be doing as a part of my curriculum.</p>
</div><div class="column" style="width:4%;">

</div><div class="column" style="width:51%;">
<p><a href="https://imgflip.com/i/6s9ym6"><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/on-teaching/https:/i.imgflip.com/6s9ym6.jpg" title="made at imgflip.com" width="100%"></a></p>
</div>

<p>All this is to say that I walked into a career involving a substantial teaching component with plenty of hesitation. The delivery was/is still largely confined to classroom settings in broadcast mode. It is not entirely clear what this format has to offer over YouTube. Basic interactivity is being increasingly solved with questions built into video players. Peer learning is quite doable with WhatsApp/Slack/Discord groups and local chapter meetups. Scale in the context of assessments is somewhat addressed by peer evaluation. And then there are all the things you can do on YouTube that you can’t do with traditional lectures: find a teacher whose style resonates, find an accent you understand, replay, play at 2x, 0.5x, binge watch, don’t watch…</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>So: what’s the incentive for <em>anyone</em> to show up in a classroom at a fixed time, especially when said time is 8AM? This question became particularly relevant during the pandemic years: once the novelty wore off, almost nobody† showed up to lectures. If I was a student, I’d likely do the same. This remains largely an open problem in my mind, but here are some pointers that have kept me motivated about the conventional format. </p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="aside">† Shout out to those of you accounting for the “almost”, thank you!</span></div></div>

<li>Classroom = theatre. I am increasingly treating it as a ground for practicing standup and <a href="https://twitter.com/neeldhara/status/1542606730701307904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">magic</a> skills. I should admit that this isn’t easy for a clinically shy person like myself, but I got used to making a fool of myself fast — that’s served well. I imagine that some of the fun that comes out performance-first lectures is hard to recreate with recordings and notes.</li>

<li><p>In a classroom setting, I can nudge the audience to discover things for themselves. As far as I know, the interactivity in online materials can help with validating understanding, but not as much with developing it from first principles. My hope is for learners to walk out of a classroom with the confidence that they <em>came up</em> with parts of the material in the textbook on their own.</p>
<p>Again, this is hard to do in time-bound fashion, given that a lot of this kind of understanding comes from brooding and hours of messing around. I can only hope to convince the audience that the process is worth the trouble.</p></li>
<li><p>The opportunity to show that you care. For learners who may have struggles with and beyond the materials — classrooms, labs, and office hours afford opportunities for us to offer help.</p>
<p>This was a late realization for me personally: for the longest time, my own sense of self-doubt did not allow me to see that I could potentially be useful to someone else. While self-doubt remains, I have started to compartmentalize it enough to show up for others.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>All this said, I believe online and remote formats have substantial potential for making quality education accessible at scale, and that it is only a matter of time before classrooms in their most conventional forms either become obsolete or a ruse.</p>

<p>It is also increasingly challenging to formulate a curricula gets people to the bleeding edge starting from the foundations.

How crucial is it to develop competencies that don’t have an immediately visible ROI? How frequently do we <a href="https://twitter.com/ramgopal_rao/status/1566428352398774272">rewrite the textbooks</a> based on developments in industry?</p>
<p>I once read a collection of answers to the question of what <em>every computer science graduate should know</em> on a Q&amp;A site. As an aspiring graduate myself, I figured I should know what I should know. Unfortunately, I remember it as a mostly unnerving experience: it was a list that started with Voronoi diagrams and ended with incompleteness theorems, and a <em>lot</em> of things in between.</p>
<p>From the other side of the fence, for whatever it’s worth — the answer to this question <a href="https://twitter.com/togelius/status/1561738432422023175">remains elusive</a>, mainly because I think it’s a context-heavy issue. For better or worse, <a href="https://twitter.com/benmschmidt/status/1562256566631518208">there is a growing interest in computer science</a>, and it will likely remain a non-trivial challenge to find an approach that is both maximally inclusive and sufficiently useful. I can only hope that between ruthless efficiency in teaching things driven purely by need and a curriculum flooded with random adventures, we can find an balance appropriate to our contexts!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why">Why</h2>
<p>Given that everything that needs to be explained has more or less been done and dusted really well on the interwebs, personally, this is hardest question of the lot. Not from my own POV, that’s the easy bit - <a href="https://dsanghi.blogspot.com/2014/08/why-i-want-to-be-professor.html">as pointed out here</a>, it’s fun to go through the idea exchange process with a captive audience, and in my experience at least one party is sufficiently triggered at the end of it (hopefully in a good way).</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The satisfaction that you get when you are able to explain a concept to someone who did not know it earlier is immense. Sometimes it could be straightforward, and sometimes it could be frustrating. But the end point is always the same - a smile on the faces of those students. Money can buy all the books, but can’t buy that smile.</p>

<p>I am just not sure if we create enough of a net positive in a traditional classroom setup from a ROI perspective. Given the few good things that the internet has brought us, perhaps it is time to think beyond classrooms and focusing on making existing resources more accessible to everyone who’s interested.</p>

<p>The city of Königsberg in Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia) was set on both sides of the Pregel River, and included two large islands—Kneiphof and Lomse—which were connected to each other, and to the two mainland portions of the city, by seven bridges.</p>

<p>The question was addressed and answered by Euler (1736). He did not solve this by “messing around” with all possible ways of walking around the city and checking if any of the walks satisfied the desired criteria. His more systematic approach involved modeling the problem abstractly, and making some key observations that ultimately led to the solution — not just for this problem, but for all problems with a similar framing!</p>

Classroom Activity with Eulerian Paths

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>The picture below shows a few popular actors, with edges connecting pairs of those who have worked together in a movie together<sup>1</sup>. The example is designed so that there are exactly two actors who participate in an odd number of pairings.</p>
<p>We can work through the “bridges puzzle” on this graph. In the classroom, we all started with the vertex representing Juhi Chawla, “walked around” using every connection exactly once, and the fun effect is that everyone ends up at the vertex representing Rishi Kapoor (or solves the puzzle incorrectly). From here, you can probably begin to guess the role of the two special vertices in the puzzle.</p>

<p>This activity is an adaptation of the example from the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-algorithms--cs215">Intro to Algorithms</a> course at Udacity, where it appears in the first chapter with the title “A Social Network Magic Trick”.</p>

<p>Here’s another similar-sounding and classic problem involving a chessboard, <a href="https://en.chessbase.com/post/euler-and-the-knights-tour">also posed to Euler</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I found myself one day in a company where, on the occasion of a game of chess, someone proposed this question: <em>To move with a knight through all the squares of a chess board, without ever moving two times to the same square, and beginning with a given square.</em>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The origins of this problem — the so-called “Knight’s Tour” — goes all the way back to the 9th century AD, where it is described in <a href="https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/reso/025/08/1095-1116">Rudraṭa’s Kavyalankara</a>. Here’s an example of a knight’s tour, as seen on Wikipedia:</p>

<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">An animated example of a knight’s tour.</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Although deceptively similar to the problem of the bridges, this is a different problem with two important contrasts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>we were previously not allowed to reuse <em>bridges</em>, here we are not allowed to reuse <em>squares</em>, and</li>
<li>we were previously obliged to use <em>every</em> bridge, here we are <em>not</em> required to make every possible move that exists.</li>
</ol>
<p>Generalizing from the 8x8 chessboard, you could ask yourself what <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(n%20%5Ctimes%20n)"> boards admit such tours.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstractions-via-graphs">Abstractions via Graphs</h2>
<p>It’s useful to model such problems using <em>graphs</em> (aka <em>networks</em>). And we’re not talking sine curves here — a graph in our context is a structure that represents relationships between entities.</p>
<p>Usually these relationships are between two entities at a time. Indeed, this is typically already quite a bit to keep track of, hence graphs that do more are said to be hyper. That is to say, graphs that model relationships involving more than two entities in one go are generally called <em>hypergraphs</em>, and they will be a story for another day.</p>
<p>For now, we will variously refer to entities as <em>vertices</em> or <em>nodes</em>, and relationships as <em>edges</em> or <em>connections</em>. Come to think of it, graphs are everywhere:</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">

<th>Two entitites are in a relationship if…</th>

<p>We usually like to distinguish between graphs where the relationships are potentially one-sided (such as people in a relationship), and those where they are mutual (such as ingredients in a recipe). Edges like these are called <em>directed</em> and <em>undirected</em>, respectively.</p>
<p>Depending on what the graph is modeling, we may not allow for entities to entertain relationships with themselves (e.g, flights don’t come back to airports they took off from). In other contexts, it makes sense to allow for this (e.g, a set always contains itself). An edge that connects a vertex to itself is called a <em>self-loop</em><sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it is reasonable that there are multiple edges between a fixed pair of vertices (for example, consider that there are several recipies that use salt and potatoes). Multiple edges are useful to model a multitude of relationships, and are often called <em>multiedges</em> when used.</p>
<p>A <em>simple</em> graph is one that does not have either self-loops or multiedges.</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth mentioning that some relationships naturally connect more two entities. For example, in an actor collaboration graph, you would find edges between Amitabh Bachchan, Juhi Chawla, and Shah Rukh Khan. You would also find edges between Akshay Kumar, Dhanush, and Sonam Kapoor. In the first example, there happens to be one film that all three actors feature in together, while this is not the case in the latter, at least at the time of this writing. As such, the graph does not have enough structure to reveal this distinction: it looks exactly the same in both cases!</p>
<p>For an actor-collaboration graph, allowing for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">-way relationships would make room for accurately capturing information about both actors and movies. Indeed, every movie could be represented by an ‘edge’ — the subset of actors who belonged to the cast. Such graphs are called <em>hypergraphs</em> or <em>set systems</em>.</p>
<p>While hypergraphs are a very useful generalization of graphs, they will be largely out of scope for our discussions in this course. To make up for that, here is a different workaround to capture all the information we have in the actor-collaboration graph example. Instead of having a vertex for every actor, we introduce a vertex for every actor <em>and</em> for every movie. Now, an actor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a"> and a movie <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m"> are connected by an edge if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a"> belongs to the cast of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m">. Observe that this approach can be used to “convert” any hypergraph into a graph.</p>
<p>A little more terminology before we move on: I promise that we’re almost done introducing new words!</p>
<p>For an undirected graph, a vertex <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> is called a <em>neighbor</em> of a vertex <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v"> if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(u,v)"> is an edge. For a directed graph, the presence of the edge <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(u,v)"> would make <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v"> an <em>out-neighbor</em> of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> an <em>in-neighbor</em> of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v">.</p>
<p>For an undirected graph, the <em>degree</em> of a vertex <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v"> is the number of neighbors of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v">. For a directed graph, the in-degree and out-degree of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v"> is the number of in-neighbors and out-neighbors of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v">, respectively.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="representing-graphs">Representing Graphs</h2>
<p>If you wanted to tell your program about a graph, there are a few different ways you could go about it. Let’s assume that we’re trying to represent a graph <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G"> on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> nodes, labeled <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1"> through <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m"> edges.</p>
<div class="callout-caution callout callout-style-default callout-captioned">
<div class="callout-header d-flex align-content-center">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-caption-container flex-fill">
How would you do it?
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Before reading further, it would be worth spending some time thinking about how you would represent a graph. Based on our discussions so far, you might counter this with the question: “Well, what do <em>you</em> need it for?” — and that’s a fair reaction!</p>
<p>Listed below are some fairly common operations that come up when dealing with graphs.</p>
<pre class="[plaintext]"><code>1. add edge u v
2. remove edge u v
3. add vertex v
4. remove vertex v
5. is u a neighbor of v?
6. find degree v</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Edge Lists.</strong> The most natural way is to perhaps just braindump the full list of edges. This gives us all we need to know about <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G">.</p>
<p>Since this is just a plain list, you could implement it either as an array or as a linked list.</p>
<p><strong>Adjacency Matrix.</strong> The other way is to block off a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n%20%5Ctimes%20n"> array <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> of integers. You could then have:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%20%5Cbegin%7Bequation*%7D%0A%20%20%20A%5Bi%5D%5Bj%5D%20=%0A%20%20%20%20%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%201%20&amp;%20%5Ctext%7Bif%20%7D%20(i,j)%20%5Cin%20E,%5C%5C%0A%20%20%20%20%20%200%20&amp;%20%5Ctext%7Botherwise.%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%5Cend%7Bcases%7D%0A%5Cend%7Bequation*%7D%0A"></p>
<p><strong>Adjacency Lists.</strong> Finally, you could have an array <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> of size <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">, with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%5Bi%5D"> pointing to a list of the neighbors of the vertex <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> if the graph is undirected, and out-neighbors if the graph is directed.</p>
<p>Again, since these are just lists, they could be, in principle, implemented either as arrays or linked lists. We will follow the traditional choice of implementing them as lists.</p>
<p>It should be no surprise at this point that there is no “right” answer to the choice of representation. You might have noticed, for instance, that an adjacency matrix always reserves <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n%5E2"> units of space to store <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G">, while the amount of space consumed by the other two representations is proportional to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m">. Notice that the number of edges in a graph can be as large as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Capprox%20n%5E2"> for simple graphs, so there certainly are graphs for which the space consumption looks the same for all representations. However, for graphs where there aren’t as many edges, then the matrix representation is likely wasteful in terms of space, although you may have other good reasons for sticking to it.</p>
<p>Let’s classify expenses incurred as follows.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Brilliant.</strong> When the procedure only needs constant time.</li>
<li><strong>Decent.</strong> When the procedure always wraps up in, and sometimes needs, time proportional to the maximum degree of the graph.</li>
<li><strong>(n/m)-tolerable.</strong> When the procedure always wraps up in, and sometimes needs, time proportional to the number of vertices/edges in the graph.</li>
<li><strong>(n/m)-painful.</strong> When the procedure always wraps up in, and sometimes needs, time proportional to the number of vertices/edges in the graph squared.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s a run down of how the representations above fare with respect to some of the common operations mentioned in the opening exercise.</p>

<p>We will keep it casual and skip formal definitions for now. 👀</p>
<p>Data structures give us principled ways to <em>stow away</em> information. It’s important to do this nicely based on what you want to <em>do</em> with the information.</p>
<p>For example, the notes you might be taking in this class is information. If you have no plans of revisiting them later, you can take them as you please, or better yet, not take them at all!</p>
<p>However, you want your notes optimised for giving you quality company during a 2AM revision session on exam day, competing with Maggi for attention, you want your notes to be competently taken: they don’t have to be neat, and it’s enough for them to be useful.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are taking notes so that a special someone who will inevitably miss a few classes will almost certainly ask for later, then you would be making notes to impress, and that potentially requires a different approach.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="representing-polynomials">Representing Polynomials</h2>
<p>Let’s say that you are spending a fine evening watching the #LockdownMath playlist from 3blue1brown. The first episode happens to be all about solving quadratics:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/dsanotes/introduction/figures/ch1-lockdownmath.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">A screenshot from #LockdownMath showing Grant Sanderson solving quadratics.</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Now, it’s quite natural to want to “write a program”, so to speak, that can take a quadratic equation such as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%5E2%20-%207x%20+%2012"> as input and output its two roots.</p>
<p>Given that programs running on your phone are able to make suggestions, even if dubious, for what series to binge-watch next on Netflix, finding roots of quadratics should be a fairly benign exercise.</p>
<p>You might recall that most programs let you declare variables that can hold on to specific <em>types</em> of information, for instance: numbers, strings, and so forth. Our input doesn’t “look” like a number, so it would be a fair take to simply store it as a string:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode java code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode java"><span id="cb1-1">px <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"x^2 - 7x + 12"</span><span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<div class="callout-note callout callout-style-default callout-captioned">
<div class="callout-header d-flex align-content-center" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target=".callout-3-contents" aria-controls="callout-3" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle callout">
<div class="callout-icon-container">

<div class="callout-caption-container flex-fill">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>While this is a perfectly faithful representation, you can imagine that it would be slightly painful to work with. You would have to write some code that can “pull out” the parts of the string that represent the <em>numbers</em> you care about (in this example, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b%20=%20-7"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c%20=%2012">), so that you can move on to your calculation, which is an <em>expression</em> involving numbers.</p>
<p>Given that a quadratic with the leading coefficient normalized to one is uniquely determined by two numbers, it seems a lot simpler to directly represent the polynomial as two integers instead:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode java code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode java"><span id="cb2-1">px_b <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">-</span><span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">7</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2">px_c <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">12</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You might appreciate that this saves us quite some circus and we can quite directly get to the computation we’re interested in. What if you cared about higher order polynomials? You may want to solve them (even if you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2543&amp;v=O5eH3x3sTNA&amp;feature=youtu.be">run out of expressions for solutions pretty quickly</a>, you might be interested in <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1386830">other ways of getting to the roots</a>), or manipulate them in other ways (for example, by adding or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7apO7q16V0">multiplying</a> them).</p>

<p>Let’s say that your program is designed to play 5 rounds and that your program is playing the copycat strategy. To begin with, you might want to declare a couple of variables to keep track of the scores of the players, and ten variables to track the moves of both players in each round. With this, your code may start out looking like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode java code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode java"><span id="cb4-1">my_points <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">0</span></span>

<p>Do you really need ten variables to track the game? If you were instead implementing the always cheat or always cooperate strategy, how many variables would you need? What about the strategies of the grudger and the detective?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now, suppose we come up with our own player, whom we call the <strong>majority mover</strong>. This player looks at your entire game history, and cooperates if you have cooperated more than you have cheated, and cheats if you have cheated more than you have cooperated, and acts randomly otherwise.</p>
<p>It seems like implementing the majority mover strategy would really require keeping track of everything. Or would it? You might observe at this point that it’s enough to keep track of two counts: the number of rounds and the <em>number</em> of moves where the user has cheated: note that it does not matter when the cheats happened in the history of the game.</p>

<p>How about a <strong>completely random</strong> player? This one chooses a number <strong>K</strong> between 1 and N uniformly at random (let’s not worry about <em>how</em> this is done for now, because that would be a story for another day), where N is the number of rounds played so far; and mimics the other player’s <strong>K</strong>th move. To implement this strategy, you really would need to keep track of the user’s entire game history with the five variables, and also assume that you have a way of picking a number at random.</p>
<p>Finally, consider that instead of fixing your program to play five rounds — 🥱 — you want to politely ask the user how m<em>any </em>rounds they want to play.</p>

<p>Well, for the first few players, this is just a matter of upgrading your for loop (which you should have switched to already when you realised that you don’t need all. those. variables.) to use N: and you are done.</p>

<p>How will you implement this version if you are working with our latest player? If you happen to have a very enthusiastic user who asks for half a million rounds, would you be able to declare that many variables all at once, while your program is running? Notably, you don’t know what the user is going to say ahead of time!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="representing-a-subset-of-a-deck-of-cards">Representing a subset of a deck of cards</h2>
<p>If you are implementing a card<sup>1</sup> game, you might need a mechanism for keeping track of “hands”, or various subsets of cards. Let’s say a <em>hand</em> is a subset of cards. For many games, you would need the ability to be able to quickly:</p>
<ul>
<li>tell if a particular card belongs to a hand or not,</li>
<li>add a card to a hand,</li>
<li>remove a card from a hand, and</li>
<li>replace a card in a hand with another one.</li>
</ul>
<p>One way to meet these requirements is to declare a collection of 52 boolean (i.e, true/false or 0/1) variables to represent the hand: the cards in the hand are set to true while cards that don’t belong are set to false.</p>
<div class="callout-caution callout callout-style-default callout-captioned">

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>What do you like about this method? What don’t you like about it?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here’a another way, though: you could agree on a notation for the cards in the deck: e.g, a standard one is to use a number, A/J/Q/K to denote the value, and S/C/D/H to denote the suit, so every card can be represented as a pair of characters. For example the Ace of Diamonds would be AD, the five of spades would be 5S and the King of Hearts would be KH. With this in place, you could represent a hand also by simply <em>concatenating</em> these string representations of the cards in the hand.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>What do you like about this method? What don’t you like about it?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now for this toy example, if you were to implement both methods and clock the time taken to implement the four operations above, you may not notice a major difference. However, for actual applications, you may be in a situation where your <em>subsets</em> (here, the “hands”) may be coming from a large <em>universe</em> (here, the “deck”). On the other hand, you may have a very large number of operations to take care of efficiently.</p>

<p>Are there other ways that you might want to store this kind of information, given the things you want to do are as enlisted above?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Your choice of method will again be driven by the requirements: the one thing to keep in mind is that you cannot have it all, but we can usually get pretty damn close!</p>

<p>Putting <a href="https://twitter.com/neeldhara/status/1506794212590768130">this thread</a> in one place.</p>
<hr>
<p>🧵&nbsp;on our latest at FUN 2022 with <a href="https://twitter.com/NRAravind1"><span class="citation" data-cites="NRAravind1">@NRAravind1</span></a> and Harshil.</p>
<p>Have you tried Solo Chess <a href="https://twitter.com/chesscom"><span class="citation" data-cites="chesscom">@chesscom</span></a> yet? It’s addictive — and NP-complete* even when you’re dealing only with rooks!</p>
<p>*when appropriately generalized</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</div>
<p>So this is a single-player, peg-solitaire-ish chess variant, where you have to clear board by making a sequence of valid captures, albeit starting with unorthodox — and even unrealistic — positions.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">

<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">An example position</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>To begin with the boards start easy, with a few pieces at a time. Notice, even in the early games, how some positions have just one solution while others may have several.</p>

</div>
<p>From initial plays, you sense that it has a very Hamiltonian-Path-ish vibe, and feels like you’re trying to find a path in <em>some</em> graph 😅&nbsp;</p>
<p>We started with a variant that was simultaneously a generalization and specialization:</p>
<ul>
<li>n pieces 😎</li>
<li>♖’s only</li>
<li>1D boards 🙈</li>
</ul>
<p>This, it turns out, is case so special that its trivial - you can sweep all rooks to the extreme left or extreme right of the board, and any position is winning even if every rook can capture exactly once. Less trivial though: how many ways there are to win? 🤔</p>
<p>We also ask what happens if every rook had a designated number of captures left. Imagine you have a 1D board and three kinds of rooks:</p>
<ul>
<li>red rooks cannot move</li>
<li>blue rooks can move at most once</li>
<li>green rooks can move at most twice</li>
</ul>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/solo-chess/CleanShot_2022-03-24_at_04.47.53.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">1D Boards</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>We show that such 1D boards can be cleared if and only if then number of green rooks is at least the number of red rooks. This ties nicely with the intuition that every immovable rook needs to be picked up by a rook that can help another one (i.e, &gt; one move left).</p>
<p>This generalizes naturally to rooks with a designated number of moves left, where said number can be anything between 0 and d.&nbsp;Since no other chess piece moves sensibly* across a 1D board, we decided to move on 2D boards from here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kings + rooks is an easy exercise.</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you are still playing with red, blue, and green rooks, then the problem of checking if a given 2D configuration can be cleared up according to solo chess rules turns out to be NP-complete.</p>
<p>No Hamiltonian Path though — this one was from bipartite dominating set 😎</p>

<p>Bishops are much the same as rooks, by a 45-degree tilt of the board.</p>
<p>⚠️&nbsp;Still open though: what about the case when all pieces have at most two moves left, which is closer to the original spirit of the game?</p>
<p>We don’t know yet, although we’d bet it’s hard, I think.</p>
<p>When playing with queens only, however, we can gadget in the behaviors of red and blue pieces. So we do have that Generalized Solo Chess with just queens that can all move at most twice is NP-complete.</p>
<p>What about pawns? Let’s get clarifying assumptions out of the way:</p>
<ul>
<li>white pawns only</li>
<li>regular captures only since there’s no premise for en passant captures</li>
</ul>
<p>In solo chess, pawns are (heavily) constrained bishops: they can only move upwards and to a neighboring diagonal square. Knowing that bishops were hard, but pawns felt simple — we didn’t have a bet either way. 🤔</p>
<p>We were pleasantly surprised that the case of pawns is tractable, even when each pawn has a designated* number of moves!</p>
<p>*at most two.</p>

<p>The algorithm is linear time, too.</p>
<p>Next: what about knights? We don’t know yet!</p>
<p>❓&nbsp;What’s the complexity of solo chess when played only with knights?</p>
<p>Knights are special because we don’t have to worry about obstructions. So the game can be described by a more general token game on graphs:</p>

<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">The Graph Capture Problem</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>We do show that Graph Capture is hard by a reduction, again from bipartite dominating set. This might hint at the hardness for Solo Chess played with knights only, but we are not betting on this yet.</p>

<p>I think these preliminary explorations have left us with more questions than answers:</p>
<ul>
<li>optimization versions (e.g, clear at least k pieces)</li>
<li>other constraints (e.g, on distance moved)</li>
<li>special cases (e.g, O(1) pieces per row/column)</li>
<li>n x c boards, constant c</li>
</ul>
<p>While at it, I’m also curious about how <a href="https://twitter.com/chesscom"><span class="citation" data-cites="chesscom">@chesscom</span></a> generates these puzzles, and if they have a mechanism for generating ones that have unique solutions.

  <title>Eight Self-Sabotaging Behaviors</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Putting <a href="https://twitter.com/neeldhara/status/1503551801378881541">this thread</a> in one place.</p>
<hr>
<p>🧵 <span class="citation" data-cites="fortelabs">@fortelabs</span> recently finished the opening keynote on <a href="https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1498668781585014785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">the Second Brain summit</a>, which incidentally has a great lineup including a panel discussion on PKM through the lens&nbsp;of ADHD. Ironically, I didn’t quite take notes but I think the themes also feature in this short video:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKM2jE2PygY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>
<p>The live session was fun because of a super engaged chat — everyone had great suggestions for managing some of these (surprisingly common?) behaviors.</p>
<p>I’ll not share the premise (it’s self-explanatory + there’s the video), but the discussion involved three parts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>why it’s an issue;</p></li>
<li><p>why-do-we-do-this-to-ourselves;</p></li>
<li><p>how do we not keep doing it 😀</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll share a tweet-length summary of my takeaways.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Caveat I: 280 chars! Twitter isn’t the platform for nuance. 😅</p>
<p>Caveat II. Should go without saying, but all of this gyaan needs to be tempered with context, which was a frequently used word throughout the session!</p>

  <title>Kidney Exchanges</title>
  <link>https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/kidney-exchanges/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>This post is based on an excellent (chalk and board!) talk that <a href="https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~palash/">Palash Dey</a> gave at IIT Gandhinagar today. This is his joint work with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/arnab-maiti/home">Arnab Maiti</a>, to appear as an <a href="https://aamas2022-conference.auckland.ac.nz/accepted/extended-abstracts/">extended abstract</a> at <a href="https://aamas2022-conference.auckland.ac.nz/">AAMAS 2022</a> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.10250.pdf">preprint here</a>).</p>
<section id="background" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background">Background</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_paired_donation">Kidney paired donation</a> or <em>paired exchange</em> allows donors to donate their kidneys to compatible patients with the understanding that their patients receive medically compatible kidneys in turn. The central problem in this setting is the <em>clearing problem —</em> which involves matching patients to donors in such a way that a maximum number of patients receive compatible kidneys. We introduce a directed graph as a convenient abstraction for this question, where:</p>
<ul>
<li>each node <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_i%20=%20(P_i,D_i)"> represents a patient-donor pair, and</li>
<li>we introduce a <em>directed</em> edge <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_i%20%E2%86%92%20v_j"> if the kidney of the donor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D_i"> is compatible with the patient <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_j">.</li>
</ul>
<p>Observe that a cycle in this directed graph naturally represents a sequence of feasible exchanges within the cycle. For example, imagine that we have a three-cycle with the edges:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(P_2,D_2)%20%E2%86%92%20(P_5,D_5)%20%E2%86%92%20(P_7,D_7)%20%E2%86%92%20(P_2,D_2)"></p>
<p>Then we have the following compatible donations:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_5"> is assigned the kidney of donor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D_2"></li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_7"> is assigned the kidney of donor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D_5"></li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_2"> is assigned the kidney of donor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D_7"></li>
</ul>
<p>This accounts for all the patients and donors involved in this cycle and motivates the following question:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Given a directed graph, what is the largest number of vertices that can be covered by a disjoint union of cycles?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While a positive answer to this question will “resolve” all the needs in the system, consider that exchanges along a cycle of length <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell"> involve <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell"> simultaneous operations to mitigate the risks involved with donors potentially backing out of the exchange agreements.</p>
<p>This motivates the following refinement of the previously posed question:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Given a directed graph, what is the largest number of vertices that can be covered by a disjoint union of cycles, where each cycle is of length <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell"> or less?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the exchanges are restricted to swaps, that is, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell%20=%202">, the problem reduces to finding a maximum matching. However, the problem is NP-complete already when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell%20=%203"> (see Theorem 1, <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/kidneyExchange.EC07.withGrantInfo.pdf">Abraham, Blum, and Sandholm</a>; EC 2007).</p>
<p>We now generalize the model a little further to account for the presence of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation#Good_Samaritan">altruistic donors</a>,</em> who are donors without a matching patient and are willing to donate to any compatible patient. To account for the presence of such donors, we modify our graph representation as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each node either:
<ul>
<li>represents a patient-donor pair <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_i%20=%20(P_i,D_i)"> or</li>
<li>represents an altruistic donor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_k%20=%20D_k%5E%5Cstar"></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The edges are as follows:
<ul>
<li>We have a <em>directed</em> edge <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_i%20%E2%86%92%20v_j"> if the kidney of the donor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D_i"> is compatible with the patient <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_j">.</li>
<li>We have a <em>directed</em> edge <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_k%20%E2%86%92%20v_j"> if the kidney of the donor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D_k%5E%5Cstar"> is compatible with the patient <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_j">.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In this setting, note that we can also facilitate exchanges along <em>paths</em> as well, with the paths starting at the altruistic donors. For instance, if we have the path:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(D_7%5E%5Cstar)%20%E2%86%92%20(P_2,D_2)%20%E2%86%92%20(P_5,D_5)%20%E2%86%92%20(P_7,D_7)%20%E2%86%92%20(P_3,D_3)"></p>
<p>Then we have the following compatible donations:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_2"> is assigned the kidney of donor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D_7%5E%5Cstar"></li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_5"> is assigned the kidney of donor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D_2"></li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_7"> is assigned the kidney of donor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D_5"></li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_3"> is assigned the kidney of donor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D_7"></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that in this situation, the donor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D_3"> is relieved from any obligation to donate to a patient. We now update our problem statement to reflect the presence of altrustic donors and the possibility of facilitating exchanges along paths:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>🤝 Optimal Kidney Exchange Along Short Paths and Cycles</p>
<p><strong>Input.</strong> A directed graph <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G%20=%20(V,E)">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BA%7D%20%5Csubseteq%20V"> are source vertices; and positive integers <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell_p">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell_c"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The main claim in the context of this problem is the following:</p>

</section>
<section id="an-algorithm-for-oke" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-algorithm-for-oke">An Algorithm for OKE</h2>
<p>Here’s a high-level description of the algorithm (perhaps best approached with some prior familiarity with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4opS8Hpvc0&amp;list=PLEAYkSg4uSQ2jI2x3Bwm711Tmjj-E25Et&amp;index=19">color coding</a>). To begin with, notice that we may assume without loss of generality that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell_p%20%5Cleq%20t"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell_c%20%5Cleq%20t"> — intuitively, this is because if the permitted cycle and path lengths are longer than the number of patients we hope to cover, then we can simply look for cycles or paths of length <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> directly to begin with — if we find one, then we are done, and if none exist, then we “might as well” set <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell_p"> and/or <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell_c"> to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t-1">.</p>
<p>Now, if there is a solution that accounts for at least <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> patients, there is also one that involves at most <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2t"> patients and in particular, also at most <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> paths. Such a solution engages at most <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> nodes from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BA%7D">. Therefore, if there is a solution, then there is one that spans <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s%20%5Cleq%203t"> vertices.</p>
<p>As is standard for color coding, we guess the correct value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> and randomly partition the vertex set <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V"> into <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> parts. The hope is that each part contains exactly one vertex from the solution (this is a so-called “colorful solution”). The probability that a random partition is a lucky one is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(3t)!/(3t)%5E%7B(3t)%7D">, which turns out to be at least <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e%5E%7B-3t%7D">. This implies that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e%5E%7B3t%7D"> repetitions ensure a constant success probability.</p>
<p>Given that the partition is indeed a lucky one, we can recover the solution using the following dynamic programming semantics. For <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C%20%5Csubseteq%20%5B3t%5D"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%20%5Cin%20%5B3t%5D">, let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D%5BC,i%5D"> be <strong>TRUE</strong> if and only if there is a colorful solution spanning at least <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> nodes outside <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BA%7D"> in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G%5BV_C%5D">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_C"> denotes the subset of vertices colored with colors from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C">.</p>
<p>The recurrence is based on isolating one path or cycle by guessing the set of colors involved in said component and using table lookups to figure out if this can be extended to a full solution.</p>
<p>In particular, we have:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D%5BC,i%5D%20=%20P%5BC,i%5D%20%5Clor%20Q%5BC,i%5D">,</p>
<p>where</p>

<p>As Palash mentioned in his talk, the preprint has more, and here are some highlights of the other results that were established:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Optimal Kidney Exchange Along Short Paths and Cycles is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameterized_complexity#FPT">FPT</a> also when parameterized by the treewidth of the underlying graph <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?+"> maximum length of path <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cleft(%5Cell_%7Bp%7D%5Cright)+"> maximum length of cycle allowed <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cleft(%5Cell_%7Bc%7D%5Cright)"> and the number of vertex types<sup>1</sup> when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell_%7Bp%7D%20%5Cleq%20%5Cell_%7Bc%7D">.</p></li>
<li><p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monadic_second-order_logic">Monadic second-order formula</a> for the problem is also presented, where the length of the formula is upper bounded by a function of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell=%5Cmax%20%5Cleft%5C%7B%5Cell%7Bc%7D,%20%5Cell_%7Bp%7D%5Cright%5C%7D">.</p></li>
<li><p>The problem admits a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernelization">polynomial kernel</a> with respect to the number of patients receiving kidneys <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?+"> maximum degree when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmax%20%5Cleft%5C%7B%5Cell_%7Bp%7D,%20%5Cell_%7Bc%7D%5Cright%5C%7D"> is a constant.</p></li>

<section id="pointers" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pointers">Pointers</h2>
<p>Some discussion that came up during the talk:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The so-called dual parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(n-t)">, which in this case corresponds to the number of patients who were “left out”, is perhaps a natural parameter to study as well.</p></li>
<li><p>The notion of a patient without a matching donor seems complementary notion of altrusitic donors. Such patients would be the last vertices on paths kickstarted by altruistic donors. However, this notion likely does not manifest in practice.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you’d like to dig deeper, be sure to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.10250.pdf">check out the preprint</a>! A few additional pointers:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>This work closely builds on the works of <a href="https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/77">Xiao and Wang</a> (IJCAI, 2018), who proposed an exact algorithm with running time <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(2%5Enn%5E3)"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> is the number of vertices in the underlying graph. They also show an FPT algorithm parameterized by the number of vertex types if we do not have any restriction on the length of cycles and chains.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/12/2/50">Lin, Wang, Feng, and Fu</a> (Algorithms, 2019) studied the version of the kidney exchange problem which allows only cycles and developed a randomized parameterized algorithm with respect to the parameter being (number of patients receiving a kidney, maximum allowed length of any cycle).</p></li>
<li><p>Alvin E. Roth was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences 2012 (along with Lloyd S. Shapley) in part for his pioneering contributions to the theory and practice of kidney exchange — his <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2012/roth/biographical/">biographical account</a> indicates that he had started anticipating the problem even before it emerged as a legal practice. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exB1O3pTf7E">talk at Simons Institute</a> surveys “fifteen years of history” in the kidney exchange problem, with an emphasis on the game-theoretic aspects.

  <title>On the Communication Complexity of Equality</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>These are some quick sketchnotes based on&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orOJRhlqrvk">this lecture</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/">Ryan O’Donnell</a>, a part of the&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prI35GmCon4&amp;list=PLm3J0oaFux3ZYpFLwwrlv_EHH9wtH6pnX">playlist</a>&nbsp;for the awesome&nbsp;<a href="https://www.diderot.one/course/28/">CS Theory Toolkit</a>&nbsp;course. You can walk through the arguments below.</p>

<p>I should mention that while the <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/11/30/the-curious-history-of-the-schwartz-zippel-lemma/">Schwartz-Zippel-DeMillo-Lipton lemma</a> is invoked in the notes below, one could make do with just the fact that over any field <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F">, any degree <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> polynomial has at most <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> roots, as pointed out by <a href="https://twitter.com/dsivakumar"><span class="citation" data-cites="dsivakumar">@dsivakumar</span></a> — thanks!</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet blockquote">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">
In the fourth slide from the end, why [DeMillo–Lipton]–Schwartz–Zippel Lemma? You only need that number of roots of a polynomial (over Z mod q) of degree n is no more than n.&nbsp;You don't need D-L/S/Z, which gives a general version for multivariate polynomials, right?

  <title>Two approaches to the 15 puzzle</title>
  <link>https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/15-puzzle/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Presenting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle">15 puzzle</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This is a sliding puzzle having 15 square tiles numbered 1–15 in a frame that is 4 tiles high and 4 tiles wide, leaving one unoccupied tile position. Tiles in the same row or column of the open position can be moved by sliding them horizontally or vertically, respectively. The goal of the puzzle is to place the tiles in numerical order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Wikipedia, <a href="https://doi.org/10.2307%2F2369492">Johnson &amp; Story (1879)</a> used a parity argument to show that half of the starting positions for the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">-puzzle are impossible to resolve, no matter how many moves are made. We are going to explore two approaches* parity-based argument to show that the puzzle shown here on the right is unsolvable.</p>
<p>*I do believe the two proofs are essentially the same with slight differences of language.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/15-puzzle/Screenshot_2021-10-03_at_10.36.37_PM.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:34.0%"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">An example of the 15 puzzle</figcaption><p></p>

</div>
<p>Common to both approaches is the idea of associating a <em>permutation</em> with every state of the puzzle. For the purposes of this discussion, we will think of a permutation simply as a sequence of elements. To turn the grid layout into a sequence, you could, for instance, line up the rows next to each other, in other words, read off the numbers from left-to-right and top-to-bottom:</p>

<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Associating the puzzle with a permutation</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>So we think of every puzzle state as a permutation over the set <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5C%7B1,%202,%20%5Cldots,%2015%5C%7D%20%5Ccup%20%5C%7B%5Cstar%5C%7D">, where we use <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cstar"> to denote the blank space. For a particular sequence <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> and an index <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1%20%5Cleq%20i%20%5Cleq%2016">, we will use <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma_i"> to refer to the element that is at the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%5E%7Bth%7D"> position in the sequence <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">.</p>
<p>A couple of definitions in the context of permutations will be useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <em>inversion</em> is a pair of elements that is out of their natural order. More precisely, if we have indices <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%20%3C%20j"> such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma_i%20%3E%20%5Csigma_j">, then the pair <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(i,j)"> indulges in an inversion. Note that the starting state of our puzzle here has exactly one inversion.</li>
<li>A <em>transposition</em> of locations <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j"> **is essentially a swap of the elements at positions <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j"> of a given permutation. So this is an operation performed on a permutation. Let’s say this again with more explicit notation — if we start with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">, then the permutation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> obtained from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> by a transposition of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j"> is given by the following:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Ctau_%5Cell%20=%20%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%5Csigma_j%20&amp;%20%5Ctext%7Bif%20%7D%20%5Cell%20=%20i,%5C%5C%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%5Csigma_i%20&amp;%20%5Ctext%7Bif%20%7D%20%5Cell%20=%20j,%5C%5C%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%5Csigma_%5Cell%20&amp;%20%5Ctext%7Botherwise.%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%5Cend%7Bcases%7D%0A"></p>
<p>The identity permutation, which we will denote by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ciota">, is special — it’s the following sequence:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5C%7B1,2,%5Cldots,14,15,%5Cstar%5C%7D.%0A"></p>
<p>It turns out that <em>every permutation</em> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> can be obtained from the identity permutation by a sequence of transpositions. This is not terribly hard to see — start with the identity permutation, and repeat the following until the permutation at hand is the one you want to see: find a location <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> that’s messed up in the current permutation, i.e, it doesn’t have the element you need in there. Find where the element is in the current permutation, and if that’s location <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">, you could perform a transposition between <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">. This fixes up the location <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i">. In every step, you fix at least one location, and never mess up anything else: so at the end of at most <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> steps (assuming you are working with a sequence of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> elements), you would be done. 🎉</p>
<p>For example, suppose the permutation you want to obtain is 3,4,2,1. Here is how the argument above would play out:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>1,2,3,4. The first location is messed up, so swap 1 and 3.</li>
<li>3,2,1,4. The second location is messed up, so swap 2 and 4.</li>
<li>3,4,1,2. The third location is messed up, so swap 1 and 2.</li>
<li>3,4,2,1. Now we are done.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that this may not be the only way of performing a sequence of transpositions that can morph <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ciota"> into <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> — there may be various roads to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">. However, it turns out that no matter what route you take to transform <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ciota%20%5Clongrightarrow%20%5Csigma">, the <em>number of steps you perform will always have the same parity.</em> So specifically, it’s <em>not possible</em> for you to have a series of, say, seventeen transpositions that turn <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ciota"> into <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">, and for me to have a series of forty-two transpositions that do the same. We will take this <del>as a cute exercise for the reader</del> as given.</p>
<p>This partitions the set of all permutations into two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>even permutations:</strong> those permutations that are reachable from the identity with an even number of transpositions</li>
<li>odd <strong>permutations:</strong> those permutations that are reachable from the identity with an odd number of transpositions</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact from the previous paragraph above makes this classification unambiguous.</p>
<p>Alright, so now we have all the terminology we need to get to the argument about why the puzzle state we started with is unsolvable. We can roll up our sleeves and get started.</p>
<hr>
<p>The first line of argument is based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1WqYKHi78&amp;vl=en">this Numberphile video</a>, and is also the one described <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15859-f01/www/notes/15-puzzle.pdf">in this 1999 American Math Monthly article by Archer</a>. We begin with the observation that every move in the game is really a transposition behind the scenes. In particular, let’s say that we are currently in state <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> and we perform some move and move to state <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">. Let’s say the permutation associated with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> was <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> and the permutation associated with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau">. It’s not hard to see that:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> can be obtained from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> with a single transposition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, note that the permutation corresponding to our target state is the following:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/15-puzzle/Screenshot_2021-10-03_at_11.04.12_PM.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">The permutation corresponding to our target state</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>In terms of the game state, notice that the final state has the blank tile at the bottom-right corner, just like we had at the start state. This means that in a hypothetical sequence of moves that morphs the initial game state into this solved state, we must have performed:</p>
<ul>
<li>an equal number of left and right moves; and</li>
<li>an equal number of up and down moves.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is not the case — imagine the blank tile traveling through the board as you perform the moves — if the number of times you moved in opposite directions did not exactly cancel, it would be impossible for the blank location to be back at it’s original location.</p>
<p>So in any winning sequence, the number of moves performed must be even. This implies that the permutation corresponding to the start state, in particular, can be obtained from the identity permutation with an even number of transformations. That makes the starting permutation an even permutation.</p>
<p>However, the permutation corresponding to the start state that we have been handed out is clearly an odd permutation: it can be obtained from the identtiy permutation by a transposition of the elements at the 14-th and 15-th positions. So, well, no dice! This shows that every solvable state that places a blank tile at the bottom-right corner must correspond to an even permutation. This does <em>not</em> automatically imply that all such states associated with even permutations are solvable* — it just shows that states with blank tiles at the bottom-right corner corresponding to odd permutations are firmly out of reach.</p>
<p>*It does turns out that all even permutations are in fact solvable.</p>
<hr>
<p>The second approach is based on the notion of inversions. This one is based on <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/video-lectures/lecture-3-strong-induction/">the Strong Induction lecture</a> in the MITOCW course on Mathematics for Computer Science. For this proof I’ll actually switch to the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?3%20%5Ctimes%203"> version of the puzzle because <del>I don’t know how to extend it to the 15-puzzle</del> the case analysis is more manageable for this version:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/15-puzzle/Screenshot_2021-10-03_at_11.30.57_PM.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:77.0%"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">A move in the 3 X 3 version of the puzzle</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>As we said before, the permutation associated with the starting point of the puzzle has exactly one inversion, while the permutation associated with the solved state, which is the identity permutation, has no inversions. So, when you make a move in the puzzle, what happens to the number of inversions?</p>
<p>As before, let’s say that we are currently in state <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> and we perform some move and move to state <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">. Let’s say the permutation associated with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> was <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> and the permutation associated with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau">. Let us say that a pair of elements <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(p,q)"> is affected by a move in the game if the relative order of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?q"> is different in the permutations <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau">. Now we have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>if we perform a row move, the relative order of all elements corresponding to numbers remains the same — in particular, all affected pairs involve <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cstar"> — so the number of inversions in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> is exactly the same as the number of inversions in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">.</li>
<li>if we perform a column move, typically the element that is being moved, say <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p">, ends up effectively jumping over two other elements, say <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b">. In this case the following scenarios arise:
<ul>
<li><p>Neither <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(p,a)"> nor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(p,b)"> is an inversion in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The long and short of all this is that after every move, the number of inversions <em>either remains the same or changes by two.</em> So no matter how many moves you perform, a state whose associated permutation has an odd number of inversions is going to remain inaccessible.</p>
<p>Tada!</p>
<hr>
<p>So there we have it… I have a feeling that a little bit of language connecting transpositions and inversions will really make these proofs quite identical, at least for the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?3%20%5Ctimes%203"> case — although I did worry that the first approach seemed to rely rather explicitly on the location of the blank tile while the second one didn’t. It is quite possible that the first one actually demonstrates more than I’m giving it credit for!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, to be honest, I haven’t thought much about pushing the second line of attack to the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?4%20%5Ctimes%204"> case — it seems already that the statement about the change in the number of inversions is no longer true and the change itself is no longer two: in particular, it could apparently go up or down by three or one instead, since the element involved in the action, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p"> is now potentially jumping over <em>three</em> other elements, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c">… so this, at least from an immediate consideration, doesn’t quite take us where we want to go.</p>
<p>Possibly one has to work with a somewhat different invariant, maybe a notion of inversions that involve triples instead of pairs? Any comments on this would be very welcome, and I’ll have an update once I understand this a little better!</p>

  <title>Sam I Am</title>
  <link>https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/cp/sam-i-am/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>This is mostly about solving Sam I Am (<a href="https://onlinejudge.org/external/114/11419.pdf">UVa 11419</a>); en route, we will end up discovering Kőnig’s theorem, which is a delightful fact about the special relationship shared by vertex covers and maximum matchings in bipartite graphs.</p>
<section id="the-problem" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Here’s an abridged version of the problem statement.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Sam is facing a temple which can be described by a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m%20%5Ctimes%20n"> grid and <strong>he has the locations of all enemies in the temple</strong> (each location can be thought of as the intersection of a row and a column in this grid).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of a sudden, he realizes that he can kill the enemies without entering the temple using the great cannon ball which spits out a gigantic ball bigger than him killing anything it runs into and keeps on rolling until it finally explodes.</p>
<p><strong>But the cannonball can only shoot horizontally or vertically and all the enemies along the path of that cannon ball will be killed.</strong></p>
<p>Sam wants to know the <strong>minimum number of cannon balls</strong> and the positions from which he can shoot the cannonballs <strong>to eliminate all enemies</strong> from outside that temple. &gt;</p>
</section>
<section id="some-initial-observations-with-an-example" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="some-initial-observations-with-an-example">Some initial observations with an example</h2>
<p>So to begin with, we have a grid with some cells identified as locations where Sam’s enemies are positioned, and here’s an example:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/cp/sam-i-am/CP-Week09-Mod03.003.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">A first example of a configuration of Sam’s enemies location</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="aside">Conveniently for us, the enemies don’t move around.</span></div></div>
<p>We want to <em>hit</em> all of these locations, and what we have at our disposal is giant cannon balls which can destroy all enemies that are positioned on a single row, or a single column. For example, if we were obsessed about only firing along rows, we would need four cannon balls to tackle ’em all, like so:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/cp/sam-i-am/CP-Week09-Mod03.006.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">A solution were we fire along rows alone</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>If Sam was superstitious about shooting along columns only, then he would again need four of these cannon balls to take care of everything:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/cp/sam-i-am/CP-Week09-Mod03.007.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">A solution were we fire along columns alone</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>However, our friend Sam is smart, not superstitious! And if there is anything that he is obsessed about, it is ruthlessly optimal destruction! In other words, he wants to fix everything up, but while using the smallest number of cannon balls possible… and if that means mixing up ranks and files, so be it — notice that you can manage with just three once you combine the use of both axes:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/cp/sam-i-am/CP-Week09-Mod03.008.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">A solution leveraging a combination of rows and columns</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>And for this example in particular, notice that three cannon balls are <em>necessary</em>, because we have at least three enemies positioned at locations that share <em>neither a row nor a column</em>, implying that no row-fire or column-fire can handle more than one of these locations at once:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/cp/sam-i-am/CP-Week09-Mod03.009.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Demonstrating that three canonballs are in fact necessary</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>So for this example, we know that:</p>
<ul>
<li>three cannon balls are necessary &amp;</li>
<li>three cannon balls are sufficient.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, let’s say that two enemy positions are <em>mutually independent</em> if they are on different columns <em>and</em> on different rows. Let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> be the size of a largest collection of mutually independent positions. Then it is clear that:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> cannon balls are necessary to handle all enemy locations;</li>
</ul>
<p>because any <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell"> fires that handle <em>all</em> enemy locations must in particular handle these <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> mutually independent ones, and each individual fire can get to (at best) one of them — by definition of what it means for two positions to be mutually independent. So if we have a valid solution involving <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell"> cannon balls, then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell%20%5Cgeq%20k">.</p>
<p>What is a less obvious, but considerably fascinating, is the fact that:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is always a strategy to hit <em>all</em> locations using just <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> cannon balls. 🤯</li>
</ul>
<p>A striking situation, no pun intended — the obvious estimate of what is needed turns out to be enough as well! The easy lower bound has a matching upper bound ❤️</p>
</section>
<section id="an-auxiliary-graph" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-auxiliary-graph">An auxiliary graph</h2>
<p>Alright, I think that’s enough with the advertising.</p>
<p>How does this work?</p>
<p>Let’s construct the following graph <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G%20=%20(V,E)"> associated with the grid and the information about enemy positions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce a vertex for every row in the grid; say <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r_i"> for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1%20%5Cleq%20i%20%5Cleq%20m">. These are the <em>row vertices.</em></li>
<li>Introduce a vertex for every column in the grid; say <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c_j"> for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1%20%5Cleq%20j%20%5Cleq%20n">. These are the <em>column vertices.</em></li>

<p>Observe that:</p>

<li>Any matching in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G"> (a collection of mutually disjoint edges) corresponds to a collection of mutually independent enemy positions back in the grid.</li>
<li>What we are looking for is a smallest-sized subset <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S"> of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V(G)"> such that every edge <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e"> in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G"> has at least one of its endpoints in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S">. Such a subset is called a vertex cover.</li>

<p>So our claim in the language of grids now translates to:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>📝 The size of a maximum matching in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G"> is equal to the size of a minimum vertex cover in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G">.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in the language of graphs. Keep in mind that as graphs go <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G">, happens to be a bipartite graph; which is to say that its vertex set can be parittioned into two parts† such that every edge has exactly one endpoint in each part.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="aside">† In this example, these parts correspond to subsets of row vertices and column vertices.</span></div></div>

<p>Is this much ado for nothing? We seem to have done some translation work, but there’s no proof of this bold claim in sight just yet… 😬</p>
<p>Fair. So here’s a roadmap for what we plan to do next:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the graph <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G"> as the basis of a flow network.</li>
<li>Recall the maxflow-mincut duality.</li>
<li><del>Profit.</del> Show the duality that we are interested in by hooking it up the known one.</li>
</ul>
<p>So first things first: we are going to setup a flow network around the graph <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G">, and here’s a partial picture of what it looks like:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/cp/sam-i-am/CP-Week09-Mod03.032.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">The flow graph</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Here’s the official description of how we build this up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with the graph <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G">, and orient every edge between a row vertex and a column vertex so that every such edge originates <em>from</em> the row vertex and latches on <em>to</em> the column vertex.</li>
<li>We assign infinite capacities to all the edges in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G">. Go unlimited on the originals! We will even dub these edges <em>original edges</em> going forward.</li>
<li>Add a source vertex <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> and add unit-capacity edges <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(s,r)"> for every row vertex <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r">. We will call these edges the <em>row selectors.</em></li>
<li>Add a target vertex <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> and add unit-capacity edges <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(c,t)"> for every column vertex <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c">. We will refer to these edges as <em>column selectors.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it, that’s the flow network <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(%5Ctilde%7BG%7D,%5Ckappa)"> based on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G">, where I’m using <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ckappa"> to denote the capacity function. Now let’s stare at any valid integral flow in this network — what does it pull out from the middle? 🤔</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/cp/sam-i-am/CP-Week09-Mod03.035.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">A matching hiding in plain sight</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Let’s make the following quick observations in the context of a valid integral flow <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f"> in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(%5Ctilde%7BG%7D,%5Ckappa)">:</p>
<ul>
<li>The flow on any edge <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e"> from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G"> (i.e, an original edge) is either zero or one. Indeed, if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f(e)%20%3E%201">, then we violate conservation constraints at both endpoints of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e">.</li>
<li>For any row or column vertex, at most one original edge incident to it is used by the flow <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f">. In other words, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f(e)%20=%200"> for all but at most one original edge incident to any row or column vertex. Again, if not, combined with the fact that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f"> is integral and that the row and column selectors have unit capacity, we will violate conservation constraints on the vertex under consideration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these observations, we have that the set of original edges for which <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f(e)%20=%201"> forms a matching in back in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G">, and in particular, if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f"> was maximum flow, then this set would correspond to a maximum-sized matching. Now, let’s look at the corresponding mincut by building the residual graph:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/cp/sam-i-am/CP-Week09-Mod03.040.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Edges in the residual graph that have a residual capacity of zero are not shown. Also, the original edges that were used by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f"> have infinite residual capacity but their corresponding back-edges have unit capacity, but this distinction is not emphasised in the picture because it’s not particularly relevant to our discussion.</figcaption><p></p>

</div>
<p>Edges in the residual graph that have a residual capacity of zero are not shown. Also, the original edges that were used by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f"> have infinite residual capacity but their corresponding back-edges have unit capacity, but this distinction is not emphasised in the picture because it’s not particularly relevant to our discussion.</p>
<p>and considering what vertices are reachable from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s">:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">

<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">The vertices reachable from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> are marked green, while all remaining vertices are marked red.</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The vertices reachable from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> are marked green, while all remaining vertices are marked red.</p>
<p>In the residual graph, I would like to draw your attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>row vertices that are unreachable from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s">,</li>
<li>column vertices from where it is impossible to reach <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will refer to these vertices as the <em>misfits —</em> they are highlighted for you in the picture below:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/cp/sam-i-am/CP-Week09-Mod03.044.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">The misfits</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Now roll up your sleeves for some magic. Let’s pull up the cut — which we know is in fact a mincut — obtained by considering the set of vertices reachable from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> the residual graph corresponding to the maxflow <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f">. In pictures, note how we have attracted some column vertices to the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s">-side, and pushed away some row vertices to the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">-side:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/cp/sam-i-am/CP-Week09-Mod03.046.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Some reorganization</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Note that this is a minimum cut, that is to say, the total capacity of the edges crossing the cut is as small as possible — which means that, in particular, the total capacity is at least (or should that be at most?) finite, and that implies, even more particularly, that <em>none</em><sup>1</sup> of the original edges cross this cut.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Remember how their capacities were infinite? So they just cannot afford to cross a minimum-capacity cut.</p></li></div></div>
<p>So every original edge is confined to the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s">-camp or the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">-camp; but note that every original edge is an edge between a row vertex and a column vertex; so if you put two and two together, you see that, in fact, <em>every edge must be incident to a misfit vertex.</em> This means that the misfits are what we were looking for all along — they form a vertex cover of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G">!</p>
<p>So at least we have <em>some</em> solution. Is this the best we can hope for?</p>
<p>Why yes!</p>
<p>Note that every misfit vertex contributes <em>exactly one unit-capacity edge</em> to the minimum cut: the misfits on the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s">-side are incident to column selectors, and these edges connect with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> on the other side; while misfits on the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">-side are incident to row selectors, and these edges connect with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s">, which is again on the opposite end. So every misfit vertex contributes exactly one edge to the minimum cut — and there are no other edges that cross the cut, so we have the following sequence of equalities:</p>
<ul>
<li>size of the proposed solution = #misfits</li>
<li>#misfits = capacity of the minimum cut</li>
<li>capacity of the minimum cut = value of the maximum flow</li>
<li>value of the maximum flow = size of a maximum matching back in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G"></li>
<li>size of a maximum matching back in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G"> = lower bound on our solution</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, we have proposed a solution whose cost matches a lower bound on it, making it optimal! With a slight adjustment of language (dropping misfits in favor of vertex cover), the sequence of inequalities above also shows that the size of a minimum vertex cover in a bipartite graph equals the size of a maximum matching in the graph.</p>
<p>This was the relationship I’d promised to cover when we started, and it goes by Kőnig’s theorem in case you’d like to find out more — the argument we came up with here isn’t perhaps the traditional proof, and this is a fact that can be established in several different ways, all fun in their own way ❤️</p>

<p>Here’s a list of 50 things<sup>1</sup> (with occasional additional context) that I install whenever I’m setting up macOS from scratch.</p>
<div class="callout-note callout callout-style-default callout-captioned">

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Bartender</p>
<p>Keeps the menubar clean. Very handy!</p></li>
<li><p>Better Touch Tool</p>
<p>I really need to leverage this a lot more, but even simple actions like swipe down with three fingers to close a tab, or tip-tap right left to move between tabs is pretty awesome already. Also use four-finger double tap to make the mouse pointer larger when it’s lost between screens… I’d guess this app can probably subsume a lot of the functionality offered by apps like Keyboard Maestro and Alfred.</p></li>
<li><p>iStat Menus</p>
<p>Good-looking stats in the menubar 👍️</p></li>
<li><p>Yoink</p>
<p>Has to be one of the best shelf apps out there. I know that there are a bunch of others in this space right now (👀, Filepane), however I have been using Yoink for so long that I haven’t considered switching. My common use-cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alfred actions to send-to-Yoink</li>
<li>Using Yoink to stash away screenshots before the floating image disappears</li>
<li>A KM shortcut that can send any Finder item to Yoink</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>CleanMyMac</p>
<p>Mostly to keep track of file sizes via the Space Lens.</p>
<p>Alternative if using only this feature: Daisy Disk</p></li>
<li><p>Default Folder X</p>
<p>Use this all the time to stash away stuff where it belongs to keep Downloads clutter-free. Also the Alfred DFX collection is handy for finding recent items even if not 100% reliable.</p></li>
<li><p>Timing</p>
<p>Use this to supplement manual time-tracking. Do not use it to its full potential at all, I think a little investment with setting up the right projects etc. can go a long way.</p></li>
<li><p>Dropzone</p>
<p>I mostly use this as a longer-term stash than Yoink. I think there are some very nice possibilities here, but the only things I’ve done with it so far include:</p>
<ul>
<li>uploading images online</li>
<li>opening a finder path in a terminal (superseded by an Alfred shortcut)</li>
<li>dropping files in select locations</li>
<li>URL shortening</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Permute</p>
<p>Handy for all kinds of (bulk) file conversions.</p></li>
<li><p>Text Sniper</p>
<p>Impressive OCR “from anywhere”.</p></li>
<li><p>Swish</p>
<p>Intuitive gestures for window management. Pretty confident all this can be done in Better Touch Tool (above), but the actions are inspiring, and I’m lazy, so yeah, this is explicitly installed.</p></li>
<li><p>Downie</p>
<p>Use this for downloading videos from Youtube for offline viewing/listening. Fairly robust.</p></li>
<li><p>IconJar</p>
<p>Icon collection, enough said. 🎁</p></li>
<li><p>Sip</p>
<p>Handy 🎨 color picker.</p></li>
<li><p>World Clock Pro</p>
<p>Visually appealing world-clock, nice for scheduling stuff across timezones, great screensaver option as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Dash</p>
<p>Documentation lookup, handy that it works inside VS Code (via an extension).</p></li>
<li><p>MindNode</p>
<p>Lovely mindmaps.</p></li>
<li><p>PDFPen</p>
<p>Although I mostly use Preview, PDFPen is useful for quickly rearranging and removing pages. Not sure about the several other features claimed, I find that it sadly crashes more often than not, so not my default application.</p></li>
<li><p>TextSoap</p>
<p>Occasional use, but very useful when I do need it for some pesky hidden-unicode-character-removal exercise.</p></li>
<li><p>MathKey</p>
<p>Niche app - on the rare occasion that I have a complicated LaTeX formula to write, I can write it in the iOS version of this app and receive it on the Mac (I don’t think the desktop app is even necessary for this; the iOS purchase can be bypassed by using the Mac app via Sidecar, but this is where I discovered the app so it makes the list).</p></li>
<li><p>Marked</p>
<p>Powerful previews for Markdown documents. Lots of interesting export features.</p></li>
<li><p>ChronoSync Express</p>
<p>This helps with keeping certain folders in sync, and setting up some backup schedules. Nothing that can’t be done with a few scripts (?) and/or Time Machine, but I did end up setting (and forgetting) a few things in here.</p></li>

<li><p>Notion</p>
<p>I’m (admittedly* experimentally) using Notion as my primary PKM tool, and it’s also where I am keeping most of my public-facing content (including this blog). My usage of Notion is gradually expanding in scope to include time/task/finance tracking as well. Too slow.</p>
<p>*and also admittedly yet-again, after a fairly committed detour through Obsidian, Craft, and VSCode extensions for several months…</p></li>
<li><p>Bibdesk</p>
<p>Fairly robust reference management that has most of what I need — priority features include speed, reliability, flexibility in generating citekeys and decent auto-filing of papers added to the database (popular free and paid alternatives that I’ve tried briefly: Zotero, Mendeley, Setne, Papers, Readcube, JabRef, Bookends).</p>
<p>Incidentally, if you are into Obsidian and Zotero, you might enjoy <a href="https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi1paKtpqfzAhWKH7cAHXO2A_EQwqsBegQIDBAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DXbGJH08ZfCs&amp;usg=AOvVaw2d18ZYU4nJEvB_CM-7-efu">this video</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>MacTeX</p>
<p>LaTeX and related tools, including TeX-friendly IDEs and reference management tools.</p></li>
<li><p>Xcode Tools, pandoc, and homebrew</p>
<p>Need these to work with code.</p></li>
<li><p>Contexts</p>
<p>The app that I miss the first when on a machine that doesn’t have it, next to Alfred. Makes window switching much more search and keyboard-driven.</p></li>
<li><p>Alfred</p>
<p>Apart from using it as a launcher (even for files), I almost use Alfred as a Finder replacement. Here are some of my favorite Alfred workflows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Menubar Search</li>
<li>Simple Folder Search (only search for folders)</li>
<li>Case Switch (combined with send-text-to-Alfred below, this can be quite nifty)</li>
<li>Symbols Search (unicode goodness)</li>
<li>Send to Yoink</li>
<li>Quit Applications</li>
<li>Send text to Alfred (double-tap the option key)</li>
<li>Color</li>
<li>Currency Exchanges</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Keyboard Maestro</p>
<p>Really elaborate shortcut/automation app. I’ve only scratched the surface with my use cases, but one of the things I really dig about my setup is simulating keypress sequences.</p>
<p>The way I do this is to activate a macro group for one action with one keyboard shortcut (e.g, CMD + ;) and then have all macros within that have one-letter or one-letter + one-modifier triggers - basically <em>very easy triggers.</em> This way, I only have to remember a bunch of high-level shortcuts for things in various categories, and from there it’s just a letter (and the same letter can be overloaded in different contexts).</p>
<p>As a concrete example, I have a macro group called launchers, and a shortcut within that for launching chrome. So something like CMD+L followed by c would launch Chrome. Although I have to confess that I mostly launch stuff through Alfred still (at the cost of one or two extra keystrokes).</p>
<p>Keypress-sequence-triggers are native to Better Touch Tool and since BTT supports AppleScript, you could also run KM macros from BTT. I haven’t quite tried this yet.</p>
<p>More advice on this <a href="https://wiki.keyboardmaestro.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_do_I_use_a_multiple_keystroke_trigger">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Typinator</p>
<p>Fast snippet expansion - faster than TextExpander (one of the main competitors in this space) in my experience. Recent updates have some rad features, which of course I’m yet to explore and exploit!</p></li>
<li><p>1Password</p>
<p>Reasonably user-friendly and robust password management. Syncs to iOS, but I haven’t managed to leverage it so much on iOS. 1Password is ideal for storing confidential information nicely (IDs, bank stuff, and the like) - if used only for passwords I suppose the Keychain does a good job too.</p></li>
<li><p>Fantastical and Calendar</p>
<p>Fantastical is a nice (but expensive!) calendar app, mostly use it because of the calendar sets feature that keeps my <a href="https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2018/2/hyper-scheduling-mechanics">time blocking calendars</a> separate from the official one that is public within the organization. Of late, I especially like the way you can join online meetings from the notifications.</p>
<p><del>Having said that, I realized that much of what I was doing with Fantastical was overkill and I’ve switched to the default calendar app for now, and it’s one paid subscription less<sup>2</sup> to have.</del></p>
<p>Ok so I am back on Fantastical, because I am kind of</p></li>
<li><p>VS Code</p>
<p>This is where I am supposed to be spending most of my time, perhaps next only to Craft/Notion. A few things from my VSCode workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use different themes for different file types (I mostly dabble in LaTeX, C++, Python, JavaScript, and Markdown)</li>
<li>Little utility extensions save a lot of time: e.g, sort lines, increment value at cursor, file management, etc.</li>
<li>Multicursor-powered find and replace is amazing.</li>
<li>Workspaces are handy and I usually launch them from Alfred.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Hook</p>
<p>Looks very promising for cross-linking stuff across apps that have a common context (say, a project). I really need to explore this more!</p></li>
<li><p>Stream Deck (best with accompanying hardware)</p>
<p>Particularly useful for switching OBS scenes although I use it less than I thought I would!</p>
<p>In particular, I want to explore their VSCode and KM integrations.</p>
<p>If without the physical device, Streamdeck does have a nice iOS app that simulates the hardware, but the pricing is based on a subscription model.</p></li>
<li><p>Google Chrome</p>
<p>I can’t make up my mind between Chrome/FF/Brave/Safari. I mostly switch between Chrome and Safari, with a mild preference for Chrome because of it’s more comprehensive extensions space, but I often end up with Safari as default for speed and privacy.</p></li>
<li><p>Readkit</p>
<p>Use this for RSS, although I’ve mostly migrated away to DEVONthink. Still looking for a nice stand-alone RSS reader though, Readkit doesn’t always render everything the way I expect, sadly.</p></li>
<li><p>OBS</p>
<p>For recording and live-streaming videos. Also useful as a virtual camera for meeting apps.</p></li>
<li><p>Screenflow and Camtasia</p>
<p>For recording videos, lots of features, still finding my way around them.</p></li>
<li><p>Slack and Discord</p>
<p>Online communities. I sometimes wish there was a native app for discourse too (is there?)</p></li>
<li><p>Keynote</p>
<p>Presentations - main alternative: Beamer + LaTeX + pgf/TikZ; or one of the JS-based slide generator tools from Markdown files (I did use react.js for one entire term).</p></li>
<li><p>DEVONthink</p>
<p>Use this fairly minimally (especially relative to the possibilities). At the moment DT indexes a couple of key finder folders and pulls in information from a lot of RSS feeds and even Twitter accounts. I try to review the stuff that automatically piles up in DT regularly, but — at the moment — it’s mostly a dumping ground and… messy.</p></li>
<li><p>Microsoft Teams, Skype, and Zoom</p>
<p>Use this for classes and online meetings.</p></li>
<li><p>Office suite: Word/Powerpoint/Excel</p>

  <title>Moving Blocks at CTIS 2021</title>
  <link>https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/moving-blocks-ctis/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I am very excited about <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ctis2021/home?authuser=0">third conference on Computational Thinking in Schools</a> (CTiS2021)<sup>1</sup>, a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fcspathshala.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHh6bbDDYykMp9_oAWqw9PhiDHKPg">CSpathshala</a> event, that’s coming up from the 29th September to 2nd October 2021 at School of Scholars, Nagpur.</p>
<p>Some background from the conference website:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The CTiS (Computational Thinking in Schools) conference is an annual event organised by the ACM (Association of Computing Machinery) and the CSpathshala community. It aims to bring together teachers, educators and researchers to discuss issues of curriculum, pedagogy, policy and implementation, related to bringing computational thinking to schools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CTiS2021 aims to provide a platform for teachers, educators and experts to share their best practices as well as challenges faced in implementing computational thinking in education. The discussions will focus on integrating CT activities (both plugged and unplugged) in various school subjects, on student learning outcomes and on disseminating findings of CT based experiments or classroom research conducted by teachers and educators across the country.</p>
<p>Our 4-day conference features key note speakers, Hal Abelson, MIT, USA, Manish Jain, IIT Gandhinagar, Patricia Ordóñez, University of Puerto Rico Río Piedras and Wolfgang Slany, TU Graz, Austria. The conference also features a workshop on CT and inclusion, conducted by Supriya Dey, Vision Empower and Manohar Swaminathan, Microsoft Research, Bengaluru and presentations of selected abstracts with sessions on implementation of computational thinking, fun activities and innovative examples used by teachers in classrooms!</p>
<p>Needless to say, I’m looking forward to this very exciting program! As a PC member, I also know that the contributed content is fantastic as well, and the aim of this little writeup is to offer a glimpse into this section of the conference.</p>
<p>In particular, I want to share with you a puzzle that was described by Rema Nair, who teaches Computer Science at the Mallya Aditi International School in Bangalore, grades 9-12.</p>
<p>To begin with, we have an equal number of blue and green boxes positioned as follows:</p>
<p>🟦 🟦 🟦 🟩 🟩 🟩</p>
<p>So the blue boxes are lined up first from left to right, followed by a space that’s exactly enough to fit one box, and then we have the green boxes lined up after the space. The goal is to arrive at the following position, which is essentially what you would have if the blue and green boxes were to switch positions:</p>
<p>🟩 🟩 🟩 🟦 🟦 🟦</p>
<p>The moves of the boxes are subject to the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The boxes from the left (i.e, the blue ones) can only move towards the right, and the boxes from the right (i.e, the green ones) can only move towards the left.</p></li>
<li><p>Boxes can move forward one space, or move two spaces by jumping over/moving past another box of a different colour (never over a box of the same colour).</p></li>
<li><p>The moves are to be made in one direction only.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The puzzle is solved when the two sets of boxes have switched positions.</p>
<p>So how would you get the boxes to switch positions? Are there multiple ways to do it successfully? If so, which strategy leads to the smallest number of moves? This should be a fun conversation-starter in class — and beyond!</p>
<p>This is a great activity with actual boxes in a physical setting, but for now, here’s a quick version that you can try out right here, thanks to <a href="https://mathigon.org/polypad">Polypad</a> by <a href="https://mathigon.org">Mathigon</a>* - be careful to not overlap the boxes one on top of the other, they will end up merging! You can always refresh this page to reset 😀</p>
<p>*Note that the numbers on the boxes are immaterial; notice that given the constraints on the directions, the relative ordering of the numbers is fixed anyway.</p>
<p>Enjoy playing for now, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ctis2021/registration?authuser=0">join us at CTiS</a> to meet Rema (and other participants).</p>

  <title>Envelope Budgeting with Notion</title>
  <link>https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/envelope-budgeting-notion/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com">YNAB</a> (c.f. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab">r/YNAB</a>) (short for <em>You Need a Budget</em>) is a budgeting application that lets you track and manage your finances. Like most apps in this category, it provides a slick interface to enter all your transactions. YNAB is more than just cataloging transactions and tracking account balances, though. The design here revolves around (and goes beyond) what is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_system">envelope budgeting</a>, which basically boils down to this:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Give every dollar a job.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can dig a little deeper into how YNAB works by looking up their <a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/the-four-rules/">four rules</a> here. I am going to try and create an envelope budgeting system in Notion that is loosely inspired by my use of YNAB.</p>
<p>To be clear, I don’t expect to stop using YNAB, nor do I expect to replicate many of its sophisticated features. Also, there are some nice envelope budgeting systems on Notion already! For instance, you might want to check out the one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/mzfog5/envelope_budget_zerobased_budget_system/">here</a> by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sff_fan_17/">u/sff_fan_17</a> or <a href="https://www.notion.so/Zero-based-Budget-21f015953116430ba4c3414a4691081e">the one here</a> by <a href="https://t.co/3Vv2zRGQuy?amp=1">Ben Smith</a>. These are really neat, but the only reason I’m not just duplicating one of them is that what I have in mind looks slightly different from the setups here. In particular, I would like the transactions to be dated and tied to specific accounts, and I would also like the system here to account for <em>all</em> the inflows and outflows in my actual system. Neither of these templates feature a hierarchy of categories either, which is something that we will attempt to do here.</p>
<p>In the first template above, I think the total income is mentioned separately, outside of the database system; and the budget covers a part of the total available income. There are explicit instructions on how to update this month-to-month, so do check this out — perhaps it works for what you might have in mind! The second template explicitly accounts for inflows, and is apparently based on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JVQzq20raZGwxnjsJhLjBrMDswOHL028dwPXdIHoeOQ/template/preview">this Google sheet</a>. It does seem that the transactions are missing information about accounts and dates, which could be a little limiting if you wanted to generate a report or a dashboard for a particular period of time. Again, a great starting point, and if it resonates with your kind of setup, it’s definitely worth duplicating and playing with. Both templates are free to access and replicate.</p>
<p>Incidentally, if you don’t use Notion and are hesitant to try YNAB, you could take a look at <a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/how-to-create-a-budget-template/">their guide to building your own budgeting template</a> — this does not require using YNAB at all and can even be made to work pen and paper. Many people have also recreated YNAB’s core features using their own favourite tools, the most popular among which appears to be Google sheets — see, for example: <a href="https://aspirebudget.com">Aspire Budget</a> (c.f. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aspirebudgeting">r/aspirebudgeting</a>) — I have not tried this myself, but it appears to be very feature-rich and neat overall.</p>
<p>That said, onto our own YNAB-esque budgeting template in Notion! We’re on our way to something that looks like this:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/envelope-budgeting-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-18_at_9.11.50_PM.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Categories</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>If you want to just skip ahead and play with the template, you can duplicate it by following <a href="http://42templates.notion.site/Template-Envelope-Budgeting-in-Notion-447cacf529dd4149b18317460b8f9805">this link</a>:</p>
<p>There are three key pieces to this setup: the first is the categories (these are the labels on the envelopes, if you like), the second is the actual transactions that take take place, and the third is a list of accounts that you have (could be bank accounts, credit accounts, virtual wallets, and so on). You would want the transactions database to be linked to both categories and the accounts. More on the exact table designs below. I’m going to assume some familiarity with Notion terminology, if this is your first time with Notion then some of this may not make sense right away, but if you could just <a href="https://www.notion.vip/how-to-create-your-first-relational-database-in-notion/">look up how Notion databases work</a> — especially the relational aspect — then I think you’d have all you need to follow along!</p>
<section id="budgeting-categories" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="budgeting-categories">Budgeting Categories</h2>
<p>It may be natural for this table to just have one row for each category. You probably want to have a small number of higher-order categories (e.g: monthly supplies, services, maintenance, health, investments, etc.) and smaller, more specific ones under these broad umbrellas (e.g, services would likely have sub-categories along the lines of internet, phone, electricity, water, etc.). You can do this by setting up a relation property to the table itself, and have it sync two-way, like so:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/envelope-budgeting-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-18_at_3.29.11_PM.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Screenshot 2021-09-18 at 3.29.11 PM.png</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<aside>
⚡ We want to make a database that captures the categories that our expenses fall under, and the budget that’s available for these categories.
</aside>
<p>If you want to see just the higher-order categories nicely, you can setup a gallery view with a filter for the main category to be empty, which would look like this (I’ve disabled the preview and added some <a href="https://www.notion.vip/icons/">icons from notion.vip</a>):</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/envelope-budgeting-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-18_at_3.33.56_PM.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">The Gallery View</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Next, we want to specify a budget for each of these categories. We can do this directly for the lower-order categories first. Then, we can have the main category budgets calculated automatically by rolling up the budgets of the corresponding child categories and adding up their budget values. To have a clean view of the budget, you could add a formula column that just adds up the values from the direct budgets and the rollup, like so:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/envelope-budgeting-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-18_at_8.18.35_PM.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Budget View</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>You can add two dummy properties with the text <code>Budgeted:</code> and <code>Remaining:</code> for each row, and set them to show along with the budget in the Gallery view so you get something like this:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/envelope-budgeting-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-18_at_3.43.12_PM.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Budgeted and Remaining Labels</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>There are two natural questions at this point:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we know that we have budgeted what we actually have?</li>
<li>How do we know what amounts are remaining at any given point of time in the month?</li>
</ul>
<p>To address both of these questions, we will need to flesh out the transactions database, link it to the categories and come back to this. But before that, let’s do a quick detour with an accounts database just to setup the foundation we need for the transactions database.</p>
</section>
<section id="accounts" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="accounts">Accounts</h2>
<p>For this demonstration, I am just going to add two accounts — one savings bank account and one credit card account:</p>
<p>The most natural property we want for the Accounts database would be a <em>balance</em> column. Instead of maintaining this manually, we will just link this with the transactions database and derive the balance by rolling up the relevant transactions.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/envelope-budgeting-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-18_at_9.49.12_PM.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Accounts View</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<aside>
⚡ The accounts database simply has one row for every account you have — these could be savings accounts, credit card accounts, a cash account, or your virtual wallets.
</aside>
</section>
<section id="transactions" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transactions">Transactions</h2>
<p>You might want to optionally add a memo property that lets you add a quick note or explanation for the transaction. However, given that each database entry is also a page, you could also quite flexibly add all the additional information you want to the page corresponding to any transaction. Meanwhile, you might also want to setup relations to other parts of your Notion setup if you find anything relevant — for instance, if you have a books database, or an inventory database, and so on. That said, we’re going to keep it simple here, and here’s an example transaction:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/envelope-budgeting-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-18_at_4.56.45_PM.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">An Example Transaction</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<aside>
⚡ Every transaction has the following: an amount, a payee, the account to which the amount was debited or credited to, the date the transaction happened, and and the expense category that the transaction belonged to. We set these up as columns with the appropriate properties, with the accounts and categories being relational links.
</aside>
<p>You’ll notice that I’ve linked to both the child and the parent category for this transaction. It would be nice if the parent category was pulled up automatically — and this is possible with a formula, but as far as I know the formula will not actually <em>link</em> the transaction to the main category. So for now, we assign both categories manually. 🤷‍♀️</p>
<p>One quick thing to do now is to go back to the Accounts database and add a rollup property that takes on the sum of the amounts property from the related transactions table, and once done, the balances show up nicely in the gallery view:</p>
<div class="columns">
<div class="column" style="width:34%;">
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/envelope-budgeting-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-18_at_4.35.18_PM.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Rollup sum of amounts in accounts</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
</div><div class="column" style="width:66%;">
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/envelope-budgeting-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-18_at_4.37.52_PM.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Gallery view of balances</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now we go back to our categories database and rename the relational column to <strong>transactions</strong> and add a rollup that collects all expenses from the transactions that happened in a particular category, so this is what it looks like:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/envelope-budgeting-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-18_at_5.50.57_PM.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Category view</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Now add a formula column <strong>available</strong> that simply adds up the budget and the expense columns so you can find out how much of your budget is still available for use. My formula looks like this:</p>
<p><code>prop("Final Budget") + prop("Expenses")</code></p>
<p>Note that it might feel more natural to subtract expenses, but my expenses are already negative amount transactions, so I just need to bundle it all together.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/envelope-budgeting-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-18_at_6.30.27_PM.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:42.0%"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Category View</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Just for fun, you could also add a <strong>status</strong> column that visually indicates how much of your budget you have left. The progress-bar style of the status property here is inspired <a href="https://www.notion.vip/notion-formulas-create-a-progress-bar/">by this guide</a>, and the formula I used requires a couple of auxiliary columns that calculate the percentage and determine if a half-star should be used or not based on the value of the decimal part. It also first checks that the available balance is in fact positive, if not, it’s going to display a suitably scary warning emoji. I won’t bore you with the specifics here, but you can find the formula in the template that I’ve linked to at the end of this post.</p>
<p>So now we are at a point where the remaining amounts are calculated based on the transactions. However, we still have to think about how to link the budgeted amounts to the actual money available. In fact, speaking of money available, I haven’t really touched upon how to handle transactions that are not expenses; i.e, transactions with a positive amount value and that reflect money coming <em>into</em> the system as opposed to leaving it. These are, of course, just regular transactions — but what category do we assign them to? All the ones we have so far really capture spends, not inflows…</p>
<p>So, it turns out that YNAB would take all this money and automatically categorize it as unassigned, or to be budgeted. We can mimic this by creating a special category called <code>to be assigned</code>, and have all income-type transactions categorized as such. Typically this would be transactions corresponding to a salary, client payments, refunds, credit from interest, and so forth.</p>

⚡ Note that transactions that just move money within your accounts, like a credit card payment, don’t need any explicit expense categories.
</aside>
<p>You also don’t need to budget separately for credit card payments, because your credit card bill is composed of transactions that were already budgeted for! Even if they were items corresponding to, say, credit card fees, you probably categorized them under Services, for example. So we won’t have a separate budget for credit card bill payments (although I should mention that YNAB does this explicitly and handles it automatically).</p>
<p>Alright, so it seems like we are nearly there, except that our current situation is the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The amount the <em>to be assigned</em> category is a true reflection of incoming funds.</li>
<li>The amounts that we added to our category budgets were setup manually and generally divorced from the reality in the transactions database.</li>
</ol>
<aside>
<p>⚡ To fix this, we need some way to move funds from the <em>to be assigned</em> category to the other ones.</p>
</aside>
<p>For example, let’s say I want to budget 750 for ebooks this month. I could do this by adding a dummy transaction that debits an amount of 750 to the <em>to be assigned</em> category and credits it to the <em>ebooks</em> category<em>.</em> What this means is that when we roll up the amounts from all transactions, we directly obtain the amount remaining for us to spend!</p>
<p>So for the very first month, when we have a clean slate, we just have a bunch of such transactions — these won’t have any explicit account associated with them because they aren’t real transactions; and in fact you can always filter your transactions table so that you only see the meaningful ones by setting the condition that the accounts column should be non-empty.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here is how we do the budgets for our categories all over again, this time via these virtual transactions:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/envelope-budgeting-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-18_at_9.57.40_PM.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Budget Overview</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>If you go to the <em>to be assigned</em> row in the categories table and look at the rollup value in the expenses column, then you’ll see that it corresponds to either the amount of money that’s still assigned (these are dollars — or in my case, rupees — that don’t have a job yet), or, in case you happen to have overshot the budget, the amount by which you are falling short. In the former situation, the available amount will be a positive number, while in the latter, it’ll be negative.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/envelope-budgeting-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-18_at_7.57.35_PM.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">To Be Assigned</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Ideally, we just want this number to be <em>zero</em>, indicating that everything has been assigned appropriately. To achieve this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If your budgets have collectively overshot the amount of money available, re-adjust them them — specifically, reduce some of the amounts — so that this is no longer the case. Of course, I am saying this from a theoretical standpoint; if your situation is that you have real expenses that you don’t have real money for, then you would want to plan for this by bringing the differential amount of money into the system via a loan, and then planning the repayment by budgeting for it as well. Dealing with debt is beyond the scope of this discussion, but I think the <a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/blog/">YNAB blog</a>, <a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/ynab-the-book/">book</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/youneedabudget">videos</a> go into this at length.</li>
<li>If you have money left over, you could either add it to your budgets, giving yourself some extra wiggle room; but I prefer to budget for fixed amounts generally, so in this situation I’ll just add this amount to something I call a <em>Miscellaneous</em> or <em>Scratchpad</em> category. It’s something you can borrow from if you fall short later, it has no particular semantics. Some people like to sweep off any excess money into deposit accounts, and if you do this, then you might want to create those accounts in the system and enter those transactions to get rid of this positive balance.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the end of this, you are in a situation where all money is nice and assigned. Since we started off by specifying budgets manually, we should go back and fix some formulas in our database of categories. In particular, here’s what I did to simplify things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the <code>Available</code> column (previously this was the difference of the manually set budget and the rolled up expenses).</li>
<li>Rename <code>Expenses</code> to <code>Available</code>, since the rollup now just reflects what’s truly available.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m going to leave the manually added budgets in — although we won’t use them to calculate what’s truly available any more, they will help us plan our budgets going forward.</p>
<p>Everything so far should make sense for an initial setup, but what do we do when we have new incoming transactions that need to be assigned to categories? I generally like to do the budgeting exercise once at the start of every month, so any intermediate positive transactions into the system will either remain in the <em>To be assigned</em> category, or if you are OCD about wanting that that category to be set to zero always, you can always push this number out into your scratchpad.</p>
<p>At the start of the month (this could be another day and a different frequency; but I do recommend being consistent for simplicity), we need to refuel the categories with the funds available. There are two kinds of things that could happen here, broadly speaking:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>For categories that represent a plan to save up to something, like a vacation, or a category where you feel like you want to have a certain amount of money set aside every month irrespective of how much you spent in the last month, you just want to push <code>budget</code> amount of money into that category via the virtual transactions we discussed earlier.</li>
<li>For other categories, which I like to think of as those having <em>rolling</em> budgets, you want to only assign the difference between what was budgeted and what was spent… and hopefully this is a non-negative quantity!</li>
</ol>
<p>You could setup a checkbox to indicate which categories have rolling budgets and which ones do not, and then this formula:</p>
<p><code>prop("IsRolling?") ? (prop("Budget") - prop("Available")) : prop("Budget")</code></p>
<p>will tell you how much you should budget for next month.</p>

<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">In this example, Ebooks are not a rolling category, so even though I need only 628.95 to meet the original budget, I’ll still set aside the full 750, and the amount that will be available will be 871.05. On the other hand, Phone is a rolling category, and presumably my phone-related expenses in the current month added up to 420, so the recommendation is to budget 420 next time so you’ll still have 500 available total.</figcaption><p></p>

<section id="the-process-after-setting-up" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-process-after-setting-up">The Process After Setting Up</h2>
<p>There are two main times that you’ll interact with this budget: whenever a transaction is made, and once every X days to reset the budgets for the individual categories.</p>
<p>Adding transactions is reasonably easy, although admittedly it’s probably not as smooth as a specialized app that might have a Siri command to do this for you or a widget that let’s you quick-add things. However, it’s not too bad, especially if you enter it right away. You could also potentially automate this via API integrations, or enter your transactions in your regular app and export them as a CSV and import them into the Notion system once every so often.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">

</div>
<p>The budgeting bit is going to be a little more work, especially if you work with a gazillion categories. The formulas will guide to you what needs to be done, but those virtual transactions still need to be added manually. On YNAB, you can do what I described above (adding the deficit to rollup categories and the originally intended budgets to the others) in one click — and there are other options too, for example, you may have moved to a new location and you’re still getting the hang of what you’ll need to set aside for groceries, so YNAB will offer to budget what you spent last month, or your average expenses from the last six months, and so on. Here, since you are assigning things manually, you can definitely tweak as you go; the <strong>next month</strong> column is just a suggestion.</p>
<p>You can probably prepare a CSV file with the default budget amounts and just merge this in at the start of every month if your expenses are super predictable, and just adjust the entries that need adjusting. This will save you some time, but remember that the categories still need to be linked to manually. It’s not too bad for something that happens once a month and that will hopefully bring you some sense of control and awareness 😇</p>
<p>Perhaps also try and not have a gazillion categories and sub-categories, at least to begin with — it helps to keep things simple, especially when starting out.</p>
</section>
<section id="common-pitfalls" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="common-pitfalls">Common Pitfalls</h2>
<p>Here are a couple of mistakes I made frequently, even while just setting up this template!</p>
<ul>
<li>Forgetting that transaction amounts corresponding to expenses should be recorded as negative numbers! If this happens very very frequently to you, you could also set this up a little differently — have a checkbox to indicate if a transaction is an expense or an inflow, and always enter a positive number reflecting the amount, and let a formula do the work of adding the sign!</li>
<li>Forgetting to add the parent category — this can mess up the views of what’s available in the high-level categories and cause the numbers to not tally. So if you need to debug your numbers, check for whether you have added both categories to your transactions or not!</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="dashboards" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dashboards">Dashboards</h2>
<p>Most of the action here is happening in the Transactions database. You could create linked copies of this database anywhere you like and filter things out to see what you want. For instance, if you want to keep tabs on the transactions in specific accounts, you could have this on your account pages:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/envelope-budgeting-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-18_at_8.47.47_PM.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Account Overview</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>You could filter out transactions for a particular month, a particular category (either a top-level category or an atomic one), and so on. I think there’s plenty you can do here, but I am not sure how much of this can be automated. For instance, you might want to generate — or have over email — a monthly report of your expenses across various categories and how did relative to your estimated budgets. This should be possible by leveraging the API and tools like Integromat/Zapier/Automate.io - but I haven’t really explored the possibilities here.</p>
</section>
<section id="missing-features" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="missing-features">Missing Features</h2>
<p>It would be nice to have a gallery view of the months of the year showing spends and budgets in each (high-level?) category. For this though I’d need the rows to correspond to months, columns corresponding to categories, which pull up transactions that happened in a particular month from said category.</p>
<p>Even if I manually linked the transactions database to this calendar one, and made sure each transaction was linked to the correct row, I don’t see how I can split up those transactions across categories, since it’s not possible to add a filter to relational columns or rollups as far as I know. It’s a similar bottleneck going through the Categories database as well. This information is of course implicit in the system, I just can’t think of a neat way of visualizing it.</p>
<p>This is possible to do for the current month though:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/envelope-budgeting-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-18_at_9.08.56_PM.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Monthly Overview</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>YNAB also has more sophisticated category types — apart from budgets that roll or accumulate, you could have categories that aim to have a certain amount of funds assigned by a certain date and so on. For those who are freelancers with incomes spread over the days of the month, I think YNAB has a lot of little features that allow for a more flexible way of budgeting, which I’m not super familiar with because I’m not in this situation. This is just to say that this setup here may be both limiting and feeing because of how much of the setup is manually done. At least that’s my optimistic view right now 😀</p>
<p>Finally, YNAB also has an option to reconcile accounts, which is when you declare that the numbers in YNAB match the book balance according to your bank or credit card agency. This is a neat little thing that I like to check off every so often. Here, I suppose you could just glance through the balances on the Accounts database (remember the gallery view from earlier?), but it won’t have the same song-and-dance-y feeling — but maybe this could be a recurring task that you can check off, and hopefully <em>that</em> will feel good 😅</p>
<p>So that’s about it! I’d love to hear any feedback on this, and suggestions for improving the setup would be very welcome too. You can duplicate the template <a href="https://www.notion.so/Template-Envelope-Budgeting-in-Notion-447cacf529dd4149b18317460b8f9805">from here</a>.</p>

  <title>Actually Building a Website with Notion</title>
  <link>https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/building-websites-with-notion/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>My attempted <a href="https://neeldhara.blog/notion-powered-websites">overview of options</a> for making websites with <a href="https://notion.so">Notion</a> does not go into the mechanics of <em>how</em> to setup a site with Notion, so I’m going to post a couple of short walkthroughs of the process here. I’ll demonstrate with both <a href="https://super.so">Super</a> and <a href="https://potion.so">Potion</a>. For Super, I’ll share how I setup my course catalog. With Potion, a natural choice would have been to take you behind the scenes of <em>this</em> blog, but this did involve a little bit of customization that might be a bit distracting, so I’ll just make something quick from scratch for this post.</p>

<section id="the-overall-process" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-overall-process">The Overall Process</h3>
<p>For either framework, this is typically a three-step process:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Setup your content in Notion. You can start from scratch, or use one of the templates provided by Super or Potion that feel like a closest match to what you want your website to eventually look like.</p></li>
<li><p>Enable sharing to the web from within Notion — this will generate a link for you.</p></li>
<li><p>Copy this link into Super or Potion.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>At the end of step 2, in fact, you already have a URL that you can share with anyone and, depending on how the content is laid out in Notion, can already look like a decent website.</p>
<p>What step 3 allows you to do, however is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Add some styling with CSS.</p></li>
<li><p>Add custom code snippets (useful, for example, if you want to add things like Google Analytics).</p></li>
<li><p>Be assured that the webpage is good in terms of SEO, performance, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>If using Super, you can selectively password-protect pages (coming soon to Potion, where you can presently password-protect your whole site if you want to).</p></li>
<li><p>Have automatically generated user-friendly URLs for the individual pages, and if on Potion, you get nice preview images for all your pages as well.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A few optional steps that you might want to consider:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>By default, both Super and Potion will give you a test subdomain to work with. Eventually, you might want the website to be available from your own domain. This is just a matter of adding a couple of A-records and typically can be done from wherever you registered the domain:</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/building-websites-with-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-12_at_10.48.49_AM.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>You might want to add custom styles to make the website render uniquely — so you move beyond the standard look-and-feel of a Notion page if you so wish. You could do something on your own here, but the simplest thing is to just borrow the styling from one of the existing templates and tweak it if you want.</li>
<li>Insert code for Google Analytics (or similar). As an aside, if you are looking for analytics that is user-friendly <em>and</em> privacy-conscious, I’d recommend <a href="https://usefathom.com">Fathom</a>.</li>

<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>Back to the setup for <a href="http://neeldhara.courses"><code>neeldhara.courses</code></a>. You can check out the page on Notion <a href="https://www.notion.so/Courses-722e231ca8e549159af5a8e7700a5025">here</a>, but I’ll describe some pieces of it below. First, recall Step 1:</p>
<aside>
<p>1️⃣ <em>Setup your content in Notion.</em></p>
</aside>
<p>I started with the <a href="https://hq.super.site">Super template HQ</a>. It looks amazing and is apparently free to use — at least at the time of this writing 😀</p>
<p>Duplicate this template into Notion. If you like, you can duplicate it twice — one, a copy that you actually work on, and the other could be a copy that you don’t edit but just keep handy in case you need to go back to the original for reference.</p>
<p>The first thing I did was to get rid of most of the content, and just retained this section:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/building-websites-with-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-12_at_11.00.55_AM.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>which, incidentally, will render like this once connected to Super:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/building-websites-with-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-12_at_11.00.26_AM.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Now the next step is to replace the generic content with yours:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/building-websites-with-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-12_at_11.03.16_AM.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Since I’m just starting out, I have added the three courses that I’m teaching this term and they all show up. Eventually, these courses will be filtered out based on the current timing, so that only the current ones show here and the rest get pushed to an archive — which I’m yet to build. But the filter would look something like this in Notion:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/building-websites-with-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-12_at_11.05.42_AM.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>And for each of those entries, I’d go and setup the course home pages with the content that I have in my typical course homepages. The nice thing about Notion is the wide array of content types that lets you format things nicely. Here are a couple of sections from within Notion:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/building-websites-with-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-12_at_11.06.32_AM.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/building-websites-with-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-12_at_1.29.01_PM.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>One thing worth pointing out for this particular setup — for each course, the class plan is just a Notion database, where the columns are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Name (text)</li>
<li>Week (single-select with 12 options; one for each week of the course)</li>
<li>Module (a checkbox property)</li>
<li>Description (text)</li>
</ol>
<p>and the rows either correspond to an overview of a whole week or just one individual lecture, tagged with the week that it happened in.</p>
<p>On the course’s homepage, I display this database set to a Gallery view, and filtered to only those entries where the Module option is <em>unchecked</em>. These are intended to be overview pages. This is what it looks like in Notion:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/building-websites-with-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-12_at_11.06.41_AM.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>and this is what it will end up looking like on the website, once you’ve gotten to the end of Step 3:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/building-websites-with-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-12_at_11.18.07_AM.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Further, overview page simply displays the same database again, this time in a list view filtered by the appropriate week:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/building-websites-with-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-12_at_11.11.43_AM.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:77.0%"></p>
<p>Check out the views in Notion and the rendered version side-by-side:</p>
<div class="columns">
<div class="column" style="width:45%;">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/building-websites-with-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-12_at_11.08.34_AM.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
</div><div class="column" style="width:10%;">

</div><div class="column" style="width:45%;">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/building-websites-with-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-12_at_11.19.08_AM.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>You might wonder about the blockquote in the Notion view right at the top of the page. That’s a feature of the HQ template — anything that goes into that first blockquote renders as page navigation on top. I think this now a bit obsolete with Super’s new features on navigation bars, but I still find it handy and use it on most pages. 👍</p>
<p>So that’s all of Step 1, getting all your content inside Notion. I’d say this is really the bulk of the process. The process is iterative, so you don’t need literally <em>all</em> your content in before you can move on. However, getting an indicative amount thrown in is, I think, useful.</p>
<p>Once you’re done with this bit, up next:</p>
<aside>
<p>2️⃣ Enable sharing to the web from within Notion — this will generate a link for you.</p>
</aside>
<p>This is very easy to do, it’s just a toggle on the top-right corner of your Notion app:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/building-websites-with-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-12_at_11.22.38_AM.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Now for the final step to have everything come together:</p>
<aside>
<p>3️⃣ Copy this link into Super or Potion.</p>
</aside>
<p>This is again quite straightforward, head to Super and just share your page’s public URL, give it a name, and optionally set it up to sync with your domain if you have one.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/building-websites-with-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-12_at_11.26.06_AM.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Given that we’re using a particular Super template, you would also need to remember to insert the CSS to make the site look as advertised above 😅</p>
<p>So remember to add this on the custom code section of your Super dashboard:</p>
<p><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="[https://sites.super.so/hq/style.css](https://sites.super.so/hq/style.css)"&gt;</code></p>
<p>If you do just this and are literally following along your site may still look a little different from mine, which is probably because I tweaked the CSS a bit to incorporate fonts of my liking (the fonts in the screenshot are from Google fonts — <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Andika+New+Basic">Andika New Basic</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Shadows+Into+Light+Two">Shadows into Light Two</a>).</p>
<p>You might want to take care of some minor things at this stage, such as adding a favicon, a site description that will show up on Google searches, inserting any code you need to for analytics, and so forth.</p>
<p>The very first time that you setup your site, you may need to wait for a bit for it to build and render. But after this first time, any edits you make on Notion are reflected automatically on your website — you may need to give it a minute or two, it’s not instantaneous, but trust that the changes will show up. Clear your cache if they don’t even after a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>Super generates pretty URLs automatically for all your pages, but because of the slightly peculiar setup I have, involving a particular nested structure and filtered views, I’ve been doing my pretty URLs manually. For example, to go to the second module of Week 5 in the competitive programming course, the URL is:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1">https:<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">//</span>neeldhara.courses<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">/</span>competitive<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">-</span>programming<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">/</span>week<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">-</span><span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">0</span><span class="er" style="color: #AD0000;">5</span><span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">/</span>mod<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">-</span><span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">0</span><span class="er" style="color: #AD0000;">2</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This can be setup quite easily from inside the Super dashboard, and once it’s done once, it’s done for good.</p>
<p>So, that’s about it! I’d like to think I covered most major aspects, but if anything is unclear, ping me <span class="citation" data-cites="neeldhara">@neeldhara</span> on Twitter and I’ll be sure to update this appropriately 🙂</p>
</section>
<section id="the-manim-examples-collection-with-potion" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-manim-examples-collection-with-potion">The Manim Examples Collection with Potion</h3>
<p>For the Potion example, I’d like to build out a quick page with latest tweets from <span class="citation" data-cites="manim_community">@manim_community</span>. Manim&nbsp;is a community-maintained Python library for creating mathematical animations, and the twitter handle pulls in a lot of great examples.</p>
<div class="callout-note callout callout-style-default callout-captioned">
<div class="callout-header d-flex align-content-center" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target=".callout-2-contents" aria-controls="callout-2" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle callout">
<div class="callout-icon-container">

</div>
<div class="callout-caption-container flex-fill">
Incidentally, if you prefer watching a video tutorial, Potion has you covered already…
</div>
<div class="callout-btn-toggle d-inline-block border-0 py-1 ps-1 pe-0 float-end"><i class="callout-toggle"></i></div>
</div>
<div id="callout-2" class="callout-2-contents callout-collapse collapse">

</iframe>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>So, for step 1, which is to get our content in Notion, I start with a blank slate and populate it with some content:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/building-websites-with-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-12_at_1.00.36_PM.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/building-websites-with-notion/Screenshot_2021-09-12_at_1.30.40_PM.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>For Step 2, I simply make this page public, and you can see the <a href="https://www.notion.so/Manim-Examples-4e4dd0c1071e4a549d90be74a84f3cce">Notion version here</a>.</p>
<p>For Step 3, I add this page to Potion and just follow <a href="https://www.potion.so/cards-portfolio">step 4 on this page</a> to set this up with a lovely template made by Dr.&nbsp;Gil Pradana (@<a href="https://twitter.com/gildy">gildy</a>). This just amounts to copy-pasting some CSS code into the <em>Snippet Injection</em> section of your Potion dashboard. This template treats horizontal line breaks as breakpoints to create cards, and the headings translate into the highlight boxes that you can see from this preview.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/gildy/status/1403680404092035075?s=20">https://twitter.com/gildy/status/1403680404092035075?s=20</a></p>
<p>After connecting my domain, here’s what the website looks like this<img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/building-websites-with-notion/FireShot_Capture_002_-_Manim_Examples_-_manimexamples.com.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>And that’s basically it! You have a fully functional page now. 🎉 Changes you make in Notion will reflect <em>instantaneously</em> on Potion!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/building-websites-with-notion/ScreenFlow.gif" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>You might wonder if there is a way of setting things up so that new tweets from the Manim community handle show up automatically on this website. In principle, this should be possible with a little help from tools like automate.io, Zapier, or Integromat — they can watch for new tweets and append them to the page you are working on, although I’m not sure how to set it up so that they respect the two-column layout that I have here. I figure tweets could also be added to a database and shown with a gallery view instead, but the gallery previews will typically not pick up embedded content, so you might have to go via an intermediate service like <a href="https://tweetpik.com/">Tweetpik</a> or <a href="https://pikaso.me/">Pikaso</a> instead so you have screenshots for display.</p>
<p>So this was Potion - you can probably see the many ways in which Potion and Super are similar to setup. By the way, the templates on these platforms are <em>not</em> mutually compatible — so watch out for the fact that they will not automatically work on the other platform if you are looking to migrate. As far as I can see, neither service has an importer for the other built yet.</p>
<p>That said, I hope you have fun making your website with Notion with whatever platform you choose to use! 🎉</p>

<p>Given that I have been spending most of my time in <a href="https://www.notion.so">Notion</a> of late, it made sense to wonder if I could use Notion, directly or otherwise, for whenever I have a need to put something up on a public website — e.g, course pages, event websites, and the like. It should go without saying that there are now a gazillion ways of putting a website together — ranging from Wordpress to modern frameworks that have made good old static sites cool again (I’m looking at you, <a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/">SSGs</a> on the <a href="https://jamstack.org">JAMstack</a>), and a whole bunch of things in between. All of this is <em>way</em> out of scope of this discussion, which is really limited to exploring the most reasonable ways of turning your Notion content into a website and is largely in the spirit of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-code_development_platform">no-code setup</a>.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="just-use-notion">Just Use Notion</h3>
<p>The official <a href="https://www.notion.so/guides/build-a-website-with-notion-in-seconds-no-coding-required">Notion documentation</a> shows us how to build nice websites with Notion:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/notion-powered-websites/Screenshot_2021-09-11_at_2.57.18_AM.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This is a great option for putting together something quick and temporary or for testing something out. It can be free (if you are on the Notion free plan) and/or will cost you nothing <em>on top of</em> what you might be paying for already if you are paying Notion user.</p>

<p>💡 If you have a more serious use-case, however, and are concerned about things like performance, SEO, custom domains, and such, and want to exercise more control over the look and feel of your site, you probably want to move beyond what you can get with xyz.notion.site. Still, a great option — involving no extra costs and right out of the box — and I’d imagine this covers a number of use-cases! 👍</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section id="fruition-and-cloudflare-workers" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fruition-and-cloudflare-workers">Fruition and Cloudflare Workers</h3>
<p>A popular way to get your domain to point to your Notion setup and customize the look and feel of the final setup just a little bit is via Fruition:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/notion-powered-websites/Screenshot_2021-09-11_at_2.55.59_AM.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>As mentioned on the website already, one downside is the setup time — but I don’t think this is a very serious drawback at all, it’s a one-time exercise and not very difficult at all given the very clear instructions given on the website. However, I think there is a more significant concern with this option, which was highlighted by @<a href="https://twitter.com/bensomething">bensomething</a> in this Tweet thread:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet blockquote">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">
Perhaps a good example of why you should avoid custom domain solutions for Notion that use those damn Cloudflare worker scripts. But hey, super excited for my new startup (fartup?) to be featured on the Founded by Monzonauts website! <a href="https://twitter.com/monzo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"><span class="citation" data-cites="monzo">@monzo</span></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hugocornejo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"><span class="citation" data-cites="hugocornejo">@hugocornejo</span></a> <a href="https://t.co/0FH916uvd2">https://t.co/0FH916uvd2</a>

<p>You could have a (potentially <em>your</em>) Fruition site intercepted with random content, <a href="https://fruitionsite.com/d291bca5556e4696b96911fb1f39efde">as is the case here</a>. As Ben points out, it’s much safer to convert your Notion content into a static site:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet blockquote">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">
Anything that converts your Notion pages to static versions is fine! It definitely seems like Super's leading the pack, but I'd say a substantial number of people are still using something like Fruition.

<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<aside>
💡 To summarize what we have with Fruition: it’s probably <em>okay</em> for a small test setup, and it’s a cool experiment — largely free (you might hit up Cloudflare’s limits eventually and be prompted to upgrade) and not much work to setup — but I’d be wary of using it in production for any non-trivial project.
</aside>
<p>…and so we’re going to explore a few ways of doing that now.</p>
</section>
<section id="nextjs-notion-starter-kit-and-react-notion-x" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nextjs-notion-starter-kit-and-react-notion-x">nextjs-notion-starter-kit and react-notion-x</h3>
<p>The <code>nextjs-notion-starterkit</code> is a NextJS template built by @<a href="https://twitter.com/transitive_bs">transitive_bs</a>, which is <a href="https://transitivebullsh.it">in active use here</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/notion-powered-websites/Screenshot_2021-09-11_at_3.11.05_AM.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>You can check out <a href="https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit">the repository here</a>. If you are feeling even braver, you might even want to explore what powers this under the hood, which is the <code>react-notion-x</code> repository <a href="https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x">here</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/notion-powered-websites/Screenshot_2021-09-11_at_3.09.44_AM.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<aside>
💡 Using <code>nextjs-notion-starterkit</code> is definitely a whole lot safer than Fruition, but it’s also clearly a whole lot more intensive in terms of setup! This option is great in terms of being free and highly customizable, but is best-suited to those who are already familiar with Next.js and who generally know what they are doing. So if the readme pages on those repositories did not make much sense, it’s probably best to either get some help on the initial setup or move on to more user-friendly, truly <em>no-code</em> options. That’s what we have up next!
</aside>
<p><code>react-notion-x</code> — from a safe distance as far as I am concerned — appears to be very well-documented and actively maintained. The documentation speaks of hosting on <a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a>, and my guess is that hosting on <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a> should also be possible. Both of these options have generous free tiers, so this could potentially be a no-cost option, although it’s far from being a true no-code option, at least for the initial setup!</p>
<p>Interestingly, <code>react-notion-x</code> appears to be supported by <a href="https://super.so">Super</a>, and from a quick glance at the source code, it seems like both Super and <a href="https://www.potion.so">Potion</a> (which are the last two options that we’ll be getting to) generate static sites using the Next.js framework… chances are that what is in these repositories is suggestive of at least a part of what’s going on behind-the-scenes with Super and Potion.</p>
<p>My understanding from exchanges with support at both Super and Potion is that there are differences in the implementation details — there are definitely visible differences that indicate this too, and apparently Super is more closely-knit into the Notion API, but I am not sure what to make of that just yet… it possibly makes their implementation a little less vulnerable to being broken by updates at Notion’s end, but I don’t know enough to say this for sure.</p>
</section>
<section id="super" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="super">Super</h3>
<p><a href="https://super.so">Super</a> (on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/super-2-0">ProductHunt</a>), built by @<a href="https://twitter.com/traf">Traf</a> and @<a href="https://twitter.com/TrillCyborg">TrillCyborg</a> (Jason Werner) appears to be one of the leading options in terms of a no-code way of porting a Notion page to a website. This will set you back $12/site/month; but you get a substantial feature set in return:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/notion-powered-websites/Screenshot_2021-09-11_at_3.47.15_AM.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I should point out that some Super templates are premium and will cost separately, but there are some really nice free ones that you can run with right away. <a href="https://hq.super.site">One that I really liked</a> happens to be free and is in use on the <a href="https://neeldhara.courses">website I have for my courses</a>. I had a completely painless setup experience and very responsive support on the minor things that I did get stuck on (h/t: @<a href="https://twitter.com/camincoll">camincoll</a>).</p>
<p>Sites made with Super are performant, SEO-friendly, and fairly customizable. There are only two minor snags I ran into with Super: one is that updates on Notion take some time to reflect on the website (typically a minute or so — this is no big deal in general, but it’s just not real-time, and can feel slow while in testing and development). The other is that their terms of service seem a bit unusually restrictive — for instance, see the discussion initiated by @<a href="https://twitter.com/kulikalov">kulikalov</a> here:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet blockquote">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">

<aside>
💡 At $12/site/month Super is the most expensive option on this list, but if the combination of performance and convenience is what you are looking for, you might find that it is totally worth it.
</aside>
<p>From Super’s responses in this conversation, I am optimistic that the ToS will change for the better. From my direct experience, my instinct is that there isn’t really anything to worry about here, but if you are someone who cares about the fine print, this is an aspect you might want to be aware of.</p>
</section>
<section id="potion" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="potion">Potion</h3>
<p>Finally, we have <a href="https://www.potion.so">Potion</a> (on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/potion-2">ProductHunt</a>), made by @<a href="https://twitter.com/noahwbragg">noahwbragg</a> (Noah Bragg), which is yet another way of getting a static site out of your Notion content in a fairly straightforward way:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/notion-powered-websites/Screenshot_2021-09-11_at_4.09.58_AM.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<aside>
💡 While oversimplified, it is tempting to summarize Potion’s offering as “Super, but cheaper”. See the next section for a more detailed discussion of differences and similarities between the two. Overall, Potion has a very similar feature set and is slightly more affordable in comparison — definitely worth checking out the same way that Super is.
</aside>
<p>The pricing is a bit different from Super — it can cost you as little as $6.25/site/month on their 8-sites plan, which will set you back $50/month, and the other two possibilities are $10/month for one site or $25/month for three.</p>
<p>In terms of what it does, it feels rather similar to Super, but as I mentioned earlier, I think there are differences in the actual implementation. In particular, one difference that is conspicuous is the way Potion renders changes — much like what happens with Notion’s own public pages, the rendering of changes with Potion happens practically in real-time. This is very helpful, especially when you are working on quick edits, or are testing things out.</p>
<p>Many other features are at par with Super: the sites created by Potion appear to be equally performant and SEO-friendly; and sites on Potion are customizable in almost the same ways.</p>
<p>This page (and the whole blog) is rendered with Potion. Like Super, setup was largely frictionless and I had prompt help whenever I needed it. Potion also has a bunch of templates that work out of the box — a couple of which are premium — but the vast majority of them are available for free and already there are some fairly nice options.</p>
</section>
<section id="potion-vs-super" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="potion-vs-super">Potion v/s Super</h3>
<p>Given the similarities between Potion and Super, I felt it was worth having a separate discussion comparing the two, and I felt like I could do a brief take on this given that I’ve spent a fair amount of time trying out both and being conflicted about which one to go with! As you can probably tell if you read this far, I could not positively conclude one way or the other, so my setups are split between the two at the moment, and it’ll probably stay this way for a while now 😀</p>
<p>Back to the comparison — there are a few differences on the minor features, here are a couple of examples off the top of my head:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Super allows password protection on individual pages, on Potion it’s all-or-none (at least at the time of this writing).</p></li>
<li><p>Potion automatically generates preview images based on titles — this is what shows up when you share a link on, say, Twitter or Discord or WhatsApp. It does this automatically for <em>all</em> pages, even ones within databases.</p></li>
<li><p>I could not get jquery to work in Potion (from trying very briefly), but it worked out fine on Super.</p></li>
<li><p>Super has a community forum and an arguably restrictive ToS. Potion has neither at the time of this writing.</p></li>
<li><p>Potion’s dashboard has a live preview editor which lets you make simple changes to the CSS and preview them real-time — this may not be something you use often if you have made sophisticated customizations, but for quick edits to the default templates, it’s very handy:</p></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/notion-powered-websites/Screenshot_2021-09-11_at_10.49.30_AM.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Super has a great dashboard too, there’s a page-by-page breakup on the sidebar and a live preview of the site to the right, which shows up even when the individual pages are password-protected (by design):</p>
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.blog/posts/notion-powered-websites/Screenshot_2021-09-11_at_10.48.54_AM.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p>In terms of custom code, a small difference is that Super allows you to insert your own content inside <em>both</em> the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags while Potion is restricted to just the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag. That said, additional possibilities for custom code injection are on Potion’s roadmap.</p></li>
<li><p>There are differences of implementation under the hood, but I am not aware of the exact details here. Super uses the Notion API and a Content Delivery Network (CDN) - this explains why changes take 1-2 mins to flow through from Notion in Super automatically, but what it does get you is reliable performance at scale. Potion uses Vercel for hosting and generates static sites that feel fast and robust, and also uses a CDN.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some of the things that I think work out rather similarly on both platforms:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Accessible and very friendly support 🤩</p></li>
<li><p>Convenient to setup and use.</p></li>
<li><p>SEO, pretty URLs, custom domains, pretty-URLs, and mostly performant websites.</p></li>
<li><p>Customized output thanks to the ability to insert your own scripts and CSS.</p></li>
<li><p>Promising roadmaps on both with exciting features on the way 🎉</p></li>
<li><p>Both options seem generally reliable - I have been monitoring my websites using <a href="https://usefathom.com">Fathom</a> and I’ve had a few downtimes reported here and there from both platforms. There was nothing that lasted more than a few minutes at a time. Because both Super and Potion use a CDN, it turns out that even if these services go down, hopefully the sites will still be served as usual.</p></li>
<li><p>You will find that both have great feedback on ProductHunt (and possibly other platforms too, but PH is the one I’m familiar with).</p></li>
</ol>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="should-you-use-notion-for-your-website-at-all">Should you use Notion for your website at all?</h3>
<p>Well. In general, if future-proofness is crazy important to you, and you want complete control over how your website renders down to the last pixel — then you might want to consider looking beyond Notion.</p>
<div class="callout-note callout callout-style-default callout-captioned">
<div class="callout-header d-flex align-content-center">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-caption-container flex-fill">
Note
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Indeed, these are early days, in some sense <em>even</em> for Notion, and much more so for all the options listed here. A few ways of turning Notion content into websites have come-and-gone, and that, I think, is in the nature of this kind of a setup.</p>
<p>At the moment, all options here other than the native Notion setup will have some obligation to keeping up with changes from the Notion side. I think most options are doing great on this front — as a recent example that comes to mind, globally synced blocks were supported shortly on all platforms after release (you do have to make sure that the pages on which such blocks originate have public access permissions).</p>
<p>I am definitely keeping my fingers crossed for the long-term viability of these options 🤞 Until then, I’m looking forward to enjoying the convenience of being able to work on my website(s) without getting out of Notion at all, at least hopefully not very much 😎</p>
<p>Incidentally, Notion’s markdown export is pretty good too, so you could just keep markdown versions of your work as you go along, so in case you decide to port things over into a more direct SSG setup in the future, it would be relatively painless to do.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Assuming you are all-in on using Notion for delivering your website, then here’s a summary of your options:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If you are looking for a free setup:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If need to use custom domains, and need sites that look and behave like regular websites, then you might want to check out <code>react-notion-x</code> or <code>nextjs-notion-starterkit</code> if you are an expert, but otherwise, the Notion route may not be the best for you.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are already a Notion user and you just need a URL with content that can go around for a super-specific purpose (i.e, website-y features not so crucial) — you can likely just use Notion’s default facility with a public URL.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>If you have a budget that is compatible with Super and/or Potion, I would definitely recommend either of them - they are both great solutions in this context! There are some nuances in terms of how they are different (e.g, pricing; Super’s apparently deeper integration with the Notion API v/s Potion’s real-time implementation, etc.), and if that level of detail is important to you, you might need to try out both — which is fortunately easy to do — before deciding.</p></li>

<p>A number of people will exchange gifts at a holiday party. Each person brings a gift to the party and attaches a label with a unique number to this gift. These numbers are also put on cards, which are deposited in a box and shuffled. Each person at the party then sequentially draws a card from the box, and receives the gift whose label corresponds to the number on the card drawn. If the number corresponds to his or her own gift, the card is returned to the box and the person draws another card. Of course, it is not possible for the last person to draw a second card.</p>
<p>What is the probability that the last person is left with the card corresponding to his or her own present? In the simple case of two people, the probability is zero. The problem is also easy to solve in the case of three people, using a chance tree. It is no restriction to imagine that the persons are numbered as 1, 2 and 3 like the labels of their presents, and that they draw a card in this order. Then person 1 gets either the present with label 2 or the present with label 3, each with a probability of 1/2. If person 1 gets the present with label 3, then the conditional probability of the last person 3 to get his or her own present is zero. If person 1 gets the present with label 2, then the cards with labels 1 and 3 are left and person 2 draws the card with label 1 with probability of 1/2, in which case the last person 3 is left with the card of his or her own present. Therefore the probability that the last person will be left with the card of his or her own present is ½ × 0 + ½ × ½ = ¼.</p>
<p>The challenges for this week are these: What is the probability that the card left for the last person corresponds to his or her own present when there are four people at the party? What is the probability when there are five people at the party?</p>
