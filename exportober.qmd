This page is about a content-creation accountability challenge, which I plan to keep open around October every year (so it's parallel to affairs like [Inktober](https://inktober.com/) and possibly a warm-up for [Nanowrimo](https://nanowrimo.org/) the following month.) You can subscribe to a feed for this series by [clicking here](exportober.xml).
