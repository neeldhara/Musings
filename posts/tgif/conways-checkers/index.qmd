Puzzle attributed to [John Horton Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway).
:::

Suppose you take the infinite square lattice and put solitaire pieces on all points $(x,y)$ that lie on or below the x-axis. Using solitaire moves, can you reach a position where the point $(0,5)$ is occupied?

Note: A solitaire move consists in a piece jumping over a neighbouring piece to a vacant square and removing (or "taking") the neighbouring piece.

You can attempt this challenge interactively [here](https://www.cleverlearning.co.uk/blogs/blogConwayInteractive.php).

_Hint: if you can’t get there, don’t feel too bad about it._

A description of the original proof based on coming up with an invariant involving the golden ratio:

A description of the original proof based on coming up with an invariant involving the golden ratio, but in this case in real-time, while thinking out loud:

A description of a more recent proof based on a rather clever and beautiful use of Fibonacci numbers:

And by the way, if you are _really_ keen on reaching row 5 [here's how you can do it](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/solarmy/) with infinitely many moves!
