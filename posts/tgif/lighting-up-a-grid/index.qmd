Here's the puzzle:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">On an nxn grid a few nodes are set on fire at t=0. The fire spreads like this: if at least two neighboring nodes of node x are lit, then node x will also catch fire in the next time step. What&#39;s the minimum number of nodes that have to be lit to burn the entire grid?<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/exportober?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#exportober</a></p>&mdash; Algorithmic Puzzles (@algopuzzles) <a href="https://twitter.com/algopuzzles/status/1450120047708409867?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 18, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Here's an argument for the lower bound by Harshil Mittal.

Consider an arbitrary but fixed solution. Let $p$ denote the number of nodes that are lit up at time $0$. Let $T$ denote the time taken to lit the entire grid. WLOG, assume that for each $1 \leq t \leq T$, exactly one new node is lit up at time $t$.

At any time $0 \leq t \leq T$,

- For every lit node $(i,j)$, let $f(i,j,t)$ denote the number of edges of the node $(i,j)$ that are not shared with another lit node.

- Let $g(t)$ denote the sum of $f(i,j,t)$ over all lit nodes $(i,j)$

We show that $g(t+1) \leq g(t)$ for all $0 \leq t \leq T-1$.

Let  $0 \leq t \leq T-1$. Let $(u,v)$ denote the new node which is lit up at time $t+1$. Let $X$ denote the set of all lit neighbors of $(u,v)$ at time $t$. For every node $(i,j)$ in $X$, we have $f(i,j,t+1) = f(i,j,t) - 1$. Also, note that $f(u,v,t+1) = 4-|X|$. Therefore,  $g(t+1) = g(t) - |X| + (4-|X|) = g(t) + 4-2|X|$. So, as $|X| \geq 2$, we get $g(t+1) \leq  g(t)$.

Now, we have $4n = g(T) \leq g(0)  \leq 4p$. Thus, $n \leq p$, as desired.
