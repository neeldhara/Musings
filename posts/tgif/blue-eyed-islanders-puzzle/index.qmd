This puzzle is variously attributed (including to "some dude on the street in Boston named Joel"), and was contributed by [Manoj Gupta](http://people.iitgn.ac.in/~gmanoj/) in our first meetup.
:::

You can read up on a relatively standard version of the puzzle from [Terrance Tao's blog](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/02/05/the-blue-eyed-islanders-puzzle/) or [here at XKCD](https://xkcd.com/blue_eyes.html).

Akash proposed a variation where not everyone sees everyone, but people see each other via a graph. What goes on in such a setting? We don't quite know!

The links have pointers to other variants and the blog also sparked a rather long discussion â€” enjoy thinking about this and looking things up!
