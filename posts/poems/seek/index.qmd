Seek poetry<br>
in a wisp of smoke,<br>
or closure<br>
in some ashes<br>

stories below<br>
newspaper headlines<br>
peace after<br>
bygone deadlines<br>

a castle<br>
in the air<br>
a choice<br>
that is fair<br>

the absence of regret<br>
on a death bed<br>
a reason, or otherwise<br>
to stay alive ---<br>

and quite likely<br>
it will be<br>
a quest unfulfilled.<br>

Find a smile instead,<br>
and you will find<br>
some strength to stay<br>
another day.<br>
