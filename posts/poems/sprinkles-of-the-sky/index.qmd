A dubious draft of air<br>
comes, goes<br>
as if wondering<br>
if the airâ€™s welcoming<br>

Soft rays tiptoe<br>
by the window<br>
as if shy<br>
to come inside<br>

Sprinkles of the sky<br>
lie in drops of dew<br>
as if captive,<br>
somewhat pensive<br>

And I snuggle deeper<br>
into a distant dream<br>
as if I could see<br>
a better place to be<br>

<sub>I stole the title from a phrase in Hairat, [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz6LoxmLJTY) that features in [Anjaana Anjaani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anjaana_Anjaani). Incidentally - I am very addicted to the entire album!</sub>
