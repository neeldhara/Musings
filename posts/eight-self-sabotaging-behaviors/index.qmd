🧵 @fortelabs recently finished the opening keynote on [the Second Brain summit](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1498668781585014785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw), which incidentally has a great lineup including a panel discussion on PKM through the lens of ADHD. Ironically, I didn’t quite take notes but I think the themes also feature in this short video:

The live session was fun because of a super engaged chat — everyone had great suggestions for managing some of these (surprisingly common?) behaviors.

I’ll not share the premise (it’s self-explanatory + there’s the video), but the discussion involved three parts:

1. why it’s an issue;

2. why-do-we-do-this-to-ourselves;

3. how do we not keep doing it 😀

I’ll share a tweet-length summary of my takeaways.

>Caveat I: 280 chars! Twitter isn’t the platform for nuance. 😅

>Caveat II. Should go without saying, but all of this gyaan needs to be tempered with context, which was a frequently used word throughout the session!

## Starting over (again and again)

⚠️  Not learning from previous mistakes.

🤔  False sense of accomplishment, dopamine hit from a clean slate, FOMO (new tools).

💡 Start simple, iterate slowly, resist looking at shiny new objects.

:::

## Feeling guilty

⚠️  Can’t win when you are at war with yourself.

🤔  Probably comes from knowing you’ll trip again.

💡 Extend to yourself the same courtesy and patience you’d show to a friend, consider replacing guilt with curiosity.

:::


:::{.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Perfectionism

⚠️  Not making mistakes is a risky way to live.

🤔  Feeds ego, sense of control and safety, and you think you push yourself harder with lofty standards.

💡 Aim for B+, fail in public and value it — can be a relief to not have to keep up with the perfect image.

:::


:::{.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Do *all* the research first

⚠️  When overdone, really procrastination in disguise.

🤔  Creates an illusion of getting work done. Paranoia associate with diving in without preparation.

💡 Second brains are not for archival, but production. Iterate often. Timebox research.

:::


:::{.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Going big

⚠️  Ambition dominates the public discourse around goal-setting. Big goals are not problematic until they get in the way.

🤔  Ego boosted, creates a potentially misguided sense of being inspired.

💡 Break things down, take incremental (read: realistic!) steps.

:::


:::{.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Doing it all yourself

⚠️  Potentially limiting.

🤔  A desire for respect or credit, and the sense that nobody can do this as well as me.

💡 Delegate when appropriate, especially when looking to scale and/or diversify.

:::


:::{.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Comparing yourself to others

⚠️  Potentially depressing.

🤔  Self-pity, and an excuse to not even try.

💡 Compare to past you. Read your old journal entries. (Also, journal.)

:::


:::{.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Postpone gratification

⚠️  For something to be sustainable, it needs to be fun!

🤔  Traditional positive quality.

💡 Enjoy the journey because nobody knows the destination. Live in the moment, find joy in the small things, be present. Also, music for instant gratification!
